      "  <meta content=\"359881 Background: Sunitinib is approved for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after imatinib failure. Ripretinib, a broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRA switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (pts) with GIST who received prior treatment with 3 or more TKIs, including imatinib. We compared the efficacy and safety of ripretinib vs sunitinib in pts with advanced GIST who progressed on or were intolerant to imatinib. Methods: This multicenter, global, randomized, open-label phase 3 study (NCT03673501) enrolled adult pts with GIST who progressed on or had intolerance to imatinib. Pts were randomized 1:1 to ripretinib 150 mg once daily (QD) or sunitinib 50 mg QD (4 wks on/2 wks off). Randomization was stratified by KIT mutational status and imatinib intolerance. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiologic review (IRR) using modified RECIST version 1.1. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by IRR and overall survival (OS). Hierarchical testing was performed for primary and key secondary endpoints in a prespecified sequence; testing pts with a KIT exon 11 primary mutation (Ex11 intention-to-treat [ITT] population) preceded the all-patient (AP) ITT population. Data cutoff was 1 Sep 2021; final analyses of PFS and ORR and the first interim analysis of OS were conducted. Results: A total of 453 pts were randomized to ripretinib (n = 226; Ex11 ITT, n = 163) or sunitinib (n = 227; Ex11 ITT, n = 164). Median age was 60 yrs (range 18–88) and most pts were white (66.2%) males (62.0%). PFS was not statistically different between ripretinib and sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.66, 1.16; P = 0.36; median 8.3 vs 7.0 mos) or in the AP populations (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82, 1.33; P = 0.72; median 8.0 vs 8.3 mos). ORR was numerically higher for ripretinib vs sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (23.9% vs 14.6%; difference 9.3%, 95% CI 0.7, 17.8; nominal P = 0.03) and AP ITT populations (21.7% vs 17.6%; difference 4.2%, 95% CI −3.2, 11.5; nominal P = 0.27). OS data was highly immature; median OS was not reached in either arm. Fewer pts in the ripretinib arm experienced Grade 3-4 (G3-4) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) vs sunitinib (41.3% vs 65.6%). Among G3-4 TEAEs with a difference ≥5% between arms, ripretinib had fewer events vs sunitinib (hypertension [8.5% vs 26.7%], palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [1.3% vs 10.0%], neutropenia [0% vs 6.3%], and neutrophil count decreased [0% vs 7.2%]). Conclusions: The PFS in both arms was longer than PFS achieved by sunitinib in its pivotal phase 3 trial. While the PFS for ripretinib did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority vs sunitinib, meaningful clinical activity and fewer G3-4 TEAEs were observed in pts with advanced GIST treated with ripretinib after imatinib failure.

       "['359881Background: Sunitinib is approved for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after imatinib failure. Ripretinib, a broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRA switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (pts) with GIST who received prior treatment with 3 or more TKIs, including imatinib. We compared the efficacy and safety of ripretinib vs sunitinib in pts with advanced GIST who progressed on or were intolerant to imatinib. Methods: This multicenter, global, randomized, open-label phase 3 study (NCT03673501) enrolled adult pts with GIST who progressed on or had intolerance to imatinib. Pts were randomized 1:1 to ripretinib 150 mg once daily (QD) or sunitinib 50 mg QD (4 wks on/2 wks off). Randomization was stratified by KIT mutational status and imatinib intolerance. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiologic review (IRR) using modified RECIST version 1.1. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by IRR and overall survival (OS). Hierarchical testing was performed for primary and key secondary endpoints in a prespecified sequence; testing pts with a KIT exon 11 primary mutation (Ex11 intention-to-treat [ITT] population) preceded the all-patient (AP) ITT population. Data cutoff was 1 Sep 2021; final analyses of PFS and ORR and the first interim analysis of OS were conducted. Results: A total of 453 pts were randomized to ripretinib (n = 226; Ex11 ITT, n = 163) or sunitinib (n = 227; Ex11 ITT, n = 164). Median age was 60 yrs (range 18–88) and most pts were white (66.2%) males (62.0%). PFS was not statistically different between ripretinib and sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.66, 1.16; P = 0.36; median 8.3 vs 7.0 mos) or in the AP populations (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82, 1.33; P = 0.72; median 8.0 vs 8.3 mos). ORR was numerically higher for ripretinib vs sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (23.9% vs 14.6%; difference 9.3%, 95% CI 0.7, 17.8; nominal P = 0.03) and AP ITT populations (21.7% vs 17.6%; difference 4.2%, 95% CI −3.2, 11.5; nominal P = 0.27). OS data was highly immature; median OS was not reached in either arm. Fewer pts in the ripretinib arm experienced Grade 3-4 (G3-4) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) vs sunitinib (41.3% vs 65.6%). Among G3-4 TEAEs with a difference ≥5% between arms, ripretinib had fewer events vs sunitinib (hypertension [8.5% vs 26.7%], palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [1.3% vs 10.0%], neutropenia [0% vs 6.3%], and neutrophil count decreased [0% vs 7.2%]). Conclusions: The PFS in both arms was longer than PFS achieved by sunitinib in its pivotal phase 3 trial. While the PFS for ripretinib did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority vs sunitinib, meaningful clinical activity and fewer G3-4 TEAEs were observed in pts with advanced GIST treated with ripretinib after imatinib failure.

       "  '359881Background: Sunitinib is approved for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after imatinib failure. Ripretinib, a broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRA switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (pts) with GIST who received prior treatment with 3 or more TKIs, including imatinib. We compared the efficacy and safety of ripretinib vs sunitinib in pts with advanced GIST who progressed on or were intolerant to imatinib. Methods: This multicenter, global, randomized, open-label phase 3 study (NCT03673501) enrolled adult pts with GIST who progressed on or had intolerance to imatinib. Pts were randomized 1:1 to ripretinib 150 mg once daily (QD) or sunitinib 50 mg QD (4 wks on/2 wks off). Randomization was stratified by KIT mutational status and imatinib intolerance. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiologic review (IRR) using modified RECIST version 1.1. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by IRR and overall survival (OS). Hierarchical testing was performed for primary and key secondary endpoints in a prespecified sequence; testing pts with a KIT exon 11 primary mutation (Ex11 intention-to-treat [ITT] population) preceded the all-patient (AP) ITT population. Data cutoff was 1 Sep 2021; final analyses of PFS and ORR and the first interim analysis of OS were conducted. Results: A total of 453 pts were randomized to ripretinib (n = 226; Ex11 ITT, n = 163) or sunitinib (n = 227; Ex11 ITT, n = 164). Median age was 60 yrs (range 18–88) and most pts were white (66.2%) males (62.0%). PFS was not statistically different between ripretinib and sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.66, 1.16; P = 0.36; median 8.3 vs 7.0 mos) or in the AP populations (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82, 1.33; P = 0.72; median 8.0 vs 8.3 mos). ORR was numerically higher for ripretinib vs sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (23.9% vs 14.6%; difference 9.3%, 95% CI 0.7, 17.8; nominal P = 0.03) and AP ITT populations (21.7% vs 17.6%; difference 4.2%, 95% CI −3.2, 11.5; nominal P = 0.27). OS data was highly immature; median OS was not reached in either arm. Fewer pts in the ripretinib arm experienced Grade 3-4 (G3-4) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) vs sunitinib (41.3% vs 65.6%). Among G3-4 TEAEs with a difference ≥5% between arms, ripretinib had fewer events vs sunitinib (hypertension [8.5% vs 26.7%], palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [1.3% vs 10.0%], neutropenia [0% vs 6.3%], and neutrophil count decreased [0% vs 7.2%]). Conclusions: The PFS in both arms was longer than PFS achieved by sunitinib in its pivotal phase 3 trial. While the PFS for ripretinib did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority vs sunitinib, meaningful clinical activity and fewer G3-4 TEAEs were observed in pts with advanced GIST treated with ripretinib after imatinib failure.

       "  '360490Background: KRAS mutation is present in 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas with p.G12C accounting for 1% to 2% of these mutations. Sotorasib, a small molecule that specifically and irreversibly inhibits KRASG12C, has been investigated in the CodeBreaK100 trial in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumors. Herein, we report on the largest dataset evaluating efficacy and safety of a KRASG12C inhibitor in patients with pretreated KRASG12C-mutated pancreatic cancer. Methods: CodeBreaK100 (NCT03600883) is an international, single arm, phase I/II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sotorasib in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumors with ≥ 1 prior systemic therapy unless intolerant or ineligible for available therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint is confirmed objective response rate (ORR), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: As of November 1, 2021, 38 patients with pancreatic cancer (mean age: 65 years, 76.3% male) from the combined phase I/II study received sotorasib 960 mg once daily. Stage IV disease was present in 55.3% of patients at diagnosis, and in all patients at enrollment. Baseline ECOG scores were 0, 1, or 2 in 31.6%, 57.9%, and 10.5% of patients, respectively. Most patients (79%) had ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy (median: 2 [range: 1-8]). Median treatment duration was 4.1 months with a median follow-up of 16.8 months. Eight patients had confirmed partial response by BICR with a resulting ORR of 21.1% (95% CI: 9.55%-37.32%). DCR was 84.2% (Table 1). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 16 (42.1%) patients. Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs occurred in 6 patients: diarrhea (2); fatigue (2); abdominal pain, ALT increase, AST increase, pleural effusion, and pulmonary embolism (1 each). No TRAEs were fatal or resulted in sotorasib discontinuation. Conclusions: Sotorasib demonstrated clinically meaningful anticancer activity and tolerability in patients with heavily pretreated KRASG12C-mutated advanced pancreatic cancer, who have limited treatment options and poor prognosis.

       "  '360922Background: In-vitro and in-vivo evidence suggests that aspirin may have an anti-tumor effect. Multiple epidemiologic studies have reported improved breast cancer survival among regular aspirin users compared to non-users. Pooled data from randomized trials of aspirin for cardiovascular disease have also reported a decreased risk of metastatic cancer among aspirin users. Thus, we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the true benefits and risks of adjuvant aspirin therapy for breast cancer survivors. Methods: The primary objective was to compare the effect of 300 mg aspirin daily versus placebo upon invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in patients with high-risk, HER2-negative breast cancer. Secondary objectives included effects on overall survival, cardiovascular disease, toxicity, and adherence. Eligible participants included patients aged 18-70 diagnosed with a primary invasive HER2-negative breast cancer. If hormone receptor (HR)–positive, tumors needed to be node positive and diagnosed within the past 10 years. If HR negative, tumors could be node positive or T2-4N0 and diagnosed within the past 18 months. Participants were randomly selected (1:1) to aspirin 300 mg versus placebo daily for 5 years in a double-blinded fashion. Stratification factors include HR status (positive vs. negative), body mass index (< or ≥ 30 kg/m2), and stage (II vs. III). Based upon an accrual goal of 2,936 patients to reach 381 iDFS events, the study was estimated to have 80% power to detect HR 0.75. Results: From January 2017 to December 2020, 3,021 participants were enrolled. Treatment arms were well balanced in terms of key characteristics. In November 2021, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board recommended that the trial be unblinded because the stratified hazard ratio had crossed a pre-specified futility boundary. After 191 iDFS events (aspirin: 107, placebo: 84) and median follow-up of 20 months, the stratified hazard ratio comparing aspirin to placebo was 1.27 (z-score: -1.64), which is greater than the pre-specified hazard ratio of futility 1.03 (z-score < -0.192). There was no difference in the frequency of grade 3/4 adverse events by study arm. Compliance was high and similar across arms. Non-protocol use of aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was similar across arms and less than 14%, consistent with prior randomized aspirin trials. Updated results on iDFS events will be provided at presentation. Conclusions: In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, there was no benefit in breast cancer invasive disease-free survival with the addition of 300 mg aspirin daily. Although inflammation may still play a role in cancer progression, aspirin is not recommended for prevention of breast cancer recurrence. Clinical trial information: NCT02927249.',\n",

       "  '362936Background: Toripalimab (anti–PD-1) in combination with chemotherapy showed significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the first-line treatment of advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify correlative biomarkers for survival. Methods: Patients (465 patients) with treatment-naïve, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK mutations were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive toripalimab 240 mg (309 patients) or placebo (156 patients) in combination with chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles, followed by maintenance of toripalimab or placebo plus standard care until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or completion of 2 years of treatment. Stratification factors included PD-L1 expression status, histology, and smoking status. The primary endpoint was PFS by investigator per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included PFS by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC), OS, and safety. Results: At the prespecified final PFS analysis (cutoff date Oct 31, 2021), a significant improvement in PFS as assessed by investigator was observed for the toripalimab arm over the placebo arm: HR, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.39-0.61); two-sided p < .0001; and median PFS 8.4 vs. 5.6 months. The 1-year PFS rates were 36.7% vs. 17.2%. PFS as assessed by BIRC was also significantly longer in the toripalimab arm. The improvements of PFS were observed across key subgroups, including histology and PD-L1 expression. At the interim OS analysis, the toripalimab arm had a significantly longer OS than the placebo arm: HR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.52-0.92); two-sided p = .0099; median OS not reached vs. 17.1 months. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs; 78.6% vs. 82.1%) was similar between the two arms. AEs leading to discontinuation of toripalimab/placebo (14.3% vs. 3.2%) and fatal AEs (5.5% vs. 2.6%) were more frequent in the toripalimab arm. WES results from 394 available patients revealed that patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB; ≥ 10 mutations per million base pairs) were associated with significantly better PFS in the toripalimab arm over the placebo arm (median PFS 13.1 vs. 5.5 months; interaction p = .026). In addition, patients with mutations in the FAK-PI3K-Akt pathway or IL-7 signaling pathways achieved significantly better PFS and OS from the toripalimab chemotherapy combination (interaction p values ≤ .01). Conclusions: The addition of toripalimab to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC provided superior PFS and OS when compared to chemotherapy alone with a manageable safety profile. These results support the use of toripalimab with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK mutations. Clinical trial information: NCT03856411.',\n",

Secondary endpoints were OS and ORR by BICR, to be tested hierarchically. The OS boundary for statistical significance was p < .04302 (2-sided) based on 69% power for a target HR of 0.75. Results: Patients (714 patients) were randomly selected to receive RELA + NIVO (355 patients) or NIVO (359 patients). Median follow-up was 19.3 mo. Updated median PFS was 10.2 mo (95% CI, 6.5–14.8) with RELA + NIVO vs. 4.6 mo (95% CI, 3.5–6.4) with NIVO (HR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.6–0.9). Median OS was not reached (NR; 95% CI, 34.2–NR) with RELA + NIVO vs. 34.1 mo (95% CI. 25.2–NR) with NIVO (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.6–1.0; p = .0593). OS rates at 12 mo were 77.0% (95% CI, 72.2–81.1) vs. 71.6% (95% CI, 66.6–76.0) and at 24 mo were 63.7% (95% CI, 58.1–68.7) vs. 58.3% (95% CI, 52.7–63.4) with RELA + NIVO vs. NIVO, respectively. Subsequent systemic therapy rates and types were generally similar between treatment groups. Confirmed ORR per BICR was 43.1% (95% CI, 37.9–48.4) with RELA + NIVO vs. 32.6% (95% CI, 27.8–37.7) with NIVO. Complete responses were observed in 16.3% of patients on RELA + NIVO vs. 14.2% on NIVO. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 75 (21.1%) patients on RELA + NIVO and 40 (11.1%) on NIVO. There were four treatment-related deaths in the RELA + NIVO group and two in the NIVO group. TRAEs (any grade) leading to treatment discontinuation were observed in 54 (15.2%) patients on RELA + NIVO and 26 (7.2%) on NIVO. Conclusions: RELA + NIVO continued to demonstrate a PFS benefit vs. NIVO alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma, consistent with the primary analysis. RELA + NIVO demonstrated a 20% reduction in risk of death and numerically improved OS rates vs. NIVO, although statistical significance was not reached for this secondary endpoint. ORR was higher with RELA + NIVO vs. NIVO. The safety profile of RELA + NIVO remained manageable with no new or unexpected safety signals. Clinical trial information: NCT03470922.',\n",

       "  '384950Background: Tislelizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb). At the interim analysis (median follow-up, 10.0 months), RATIONALE-309 met its primary endpoint, as first-line tislelizumab + chemotherapy significantly improved PFS, as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), in patients with recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (RM NPC) compared with placebo + chemotherapy. Tislelizumab + chemotherapy had an acceptable safety profile, comparable to placebo + chemotherapy (Yang Y, et\\xa0al. ESMO-IO Virtual Congress, 2021. Oral presentation 121O). Here, we report an updated analysis of PFS, PFS after next line of treatment (PFS2), and overall survival (OS) with an extended median follow-up of 15.5 months. Methods: A total of 263 eligible patients with RM NPC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) or placebo on day 1, plus gemcitabine (1 g/m2 IV day 1, day 8), plus cisplatin (80 mg/m2 day 1) every 3 weeks for 4–6 cycles, followed by tislelizumab or placebo every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. After IRC-confirmed disease progression, patients in the placebo arm could crossover to receive tislelizumab monotherapy. The primary endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints included IRC-assessed objective response rate and duration of response, investigator-assessed PFS and PFS2, and OS. Biomarker analysis was an exploratory endpoint. Results: At an updated data cut-off (September 30, 2021), IRC-assessed PFS was consistent with the interim data analysis and demonstrated significant improvement for tislelizumab + chemotherapy versus placebo + chemotherapy (median PFS, 9.6 vs. 7.4 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37, 0.68). Median PFS2 and OS were not reached for the tislelizumab + chemotherapy arm and were 13.9 months and 23.0 months for the placebo + chemotherapy arm, respectively. The HRs were 0.38 (95% CI, 0.25, 0.58) for PFS2 and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35, 1.01) for OS. The association of tumor microenvironment features by gene-expression analysis with clinical benefit will be presented. Conclusions: Tislelizumab + chemotherapy showed consistent, clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with placebo + chemotherapy in this updated analysis. Clinically meaningful improvements in PFS2 and OS were also observed for the tislelizumab + chemotherapy arm. This is the first report of PFS2 benefit for an anti–PD-1 mAb in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment setting of RM NPC. These results support the use of tislelizumab + chemotherapy as first-line therapy for RM NPC. Clinical trial information: NCT03924986.',\n",

       "  '388570Background: Few studies have aimed to investigate the prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Given the growing opportunities for precision therapies based on PGVs in DNA damage-repair (DDR)/homologous recombination-repair (HRR) genes and the importance of identifying PGVs to inform future cancer screening and cascade testing, we investigated the prevalence and potential clinical implications of PGVs in individuals with lung cancer. Methods: Deidentified data were retrospectively reviewed for 7,788 individuals diagnosed with lung cancer for whom germline DNA sequencing and exon-level copy number analysis were performed between 2014-2022 at a commercial diagnostic laboratory. The diagnosis of lung cancer was based on ICD-10 codes or language on the test requisition suggesting a primary lung cancer diagnosis. Individuals with requisitions suggesting lung metastases, neuroendocrine tumors or sarcomas as the basis for testing were excluded. Number of genes tested varied per ordering clinician preference. Clinically actionable PGVs were defined as those associated with clinical management recommendations or trial eligibility per current, standard of care guidelines. Descriptive statistics were utilized. Results: The cohort was predominantly female (71.1%), White (64.5%), and most had a history of > 1 cancer (71.1%). A median of 79 genes (range 1-159) were tested. Testing identified 1,503 PGVs in 81 known cancer-risk genes in 1,161/7,788 (14.9%) patients; an additional 229 (2.9%) patients carried a single PGV in a gene associated with autosomal recessive inheritance. PGV rates stratified by self-reported ancestry: Black/African American, 11.8%; Asian or Pacific Islander, 11.8%; Hispanic, 14.5%; White, 15.4%. Among genes with >1,000 individuals tested, PGVs were most common in BRCA2 (2.8%), CHEK2 (2.1%), ATM (1.9%), TP53 (1.3%), BRCA1 (1.2%), and EGFR (1.0%). Of 1,161 individuals, 712 (61.3%) had a PGV in a DDR/HRR gene, making them potentially eligible for a clinical treatment trial, and 1,104/1,161 (95.1%) had a PGV that was potentially clinically actionable. Conclusions: From this large cohort of individuals with lung cancer, 14.9% had PGVs, nearly all of which were clinically actionable. Notably, HRR PGVs were common (64%). Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines endorse targeted therapies for patients with breast, pancreatic, prostate, and ovarian cancers who carry HRR PGVs. Recently, the NCCN Guidelines panel recommended germline testing be considered for all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Given the profound implications for both patients and their families that result from identifying PGVs, our results suggest that all patients with lung cancer also be considered for germline genetic testing.']]"

       "  'LBA1Background: PARADIGM is the first prospective trial to test the superiority of PAN vs. BEV in combination with standard doublet first-line chemotherapy for patients (pts) with RAS WT mCRC and left-sided primary tumors. Methods: This open-label, multicenter trial in Japan (NCT02394795) randomly selected pts with chemotherapy-naive RAS WT mCRC to PAN + mFOLFOX6 or BEV + mFOLFOX6. Overall survival (OS) as primary endpoint was hierarchically tested in patients with left-sided tumors, followed by those in the full-analysis set (FAS) population. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and curative resection (R0) rate. Results: From May 2015 to June 2017, 823 pts were randomized; 12 did not receive protocol treatment and 9 were excluded due to major deviation of inclusion criteria. A total of 400 pts received PAN and 402 pts received BEV as FAS; 312 and 292 pts had left-sided primary tumors, respectively. OS was analyzed after 448 OS events in left-sided pts with a median follow-up of 61 months. PAN significantly improved OS vs. BEV in both populations: left-sided (HR, 0.82; 95.798% CI, 0.68-0.99, p = .031, which crossed the boundary of significance [0.042]), and FAS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; p = .030, with < 0.05 as the boundary). Although PFS was comparable between treatment groups, RR and R0 resection rates were higher with PAN compared with BEV (Table). HR for OS in the right-sided population was 1.09. No new safety signal was observed. Conclusions: PAN significantly improved OS vs. BEV in combination with mFOLFOX6 in pts with RAS WT and left-sided mCRC, establishing a standard first-line combination regimen for this population.

Methods: Patients aged 4-50 with RR-ES were randomly assigned to topotecan and cyclophosphamide (TC), irinotecan and temolozomide (IT), gemcitabine and docetaxel (GD), or high-dose ifosfamide (IFOS). Primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS) for the phase III comparison. Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL). A probability-based Bayesian approach was used with multiple pairwise comparisons. At the first and second interim assessments, patients allocated to GD and IT, respectively, had worse objective response (OR) and EFS than the other arms, halting recruitment to both. The final intent-to-treat assessment of the original four arms was a phase III evaluation of TC and IFOS. Results: 451 patients recruited between 18/12/14 and 31/08/21, were randomly assigned to TC (163 patients), IT (127 patients), GD (72 patients), and IFOS (83 patients). Median age was 19 years (range 4-49). Patients had: refractory disease (18%), first recurrence (66%), > first recurrence (17%). Initial disease site was bone in 70%. Sites of progression were: primary site only (15%), pleuropulmonary metastases only (34%), and other metastatic (51%). Baseline renal function was similar in both. Median follow-up (reverse Kaplan-Meier method) was 40 months. For the phase III comparison between TC and IFOS (both, 73 patients), median EFS was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.1-6.2) for TC and 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.8-7.0) for IFOS. Median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.5-15.5) for TC and 16.8 months (95% CI, 11.1-25.8) for IFOS. Given the observed data, the posterior probability that EFS and OS were better after IFOS than after TC (ie Pr [true hazard ratio < 1 | data]) was 95% for both. A greater survival difference was observed for patients aged under 14 than those aged ≥ 14 for EFS and OS. Subgroup analyses favored IFOS for all minimization factors. The main grade 3/4 adverse events (% patients with an event) for TC (left-hand values) compared with IFOS were: febrile neutropenia (26% vs. 25%), infections (8% vs. 14%), vomiting (1% vs. 1%), nausea (0% vs. 3%), diarrhea (1% vs. 1%), encephalopathy (0% vs. 7%), and renal toxicity (0% vs. 8%). Descriptive statistics of quality of life scores appeared to favor the IFOS arm over the TC arm in children but not in adults. Conclusions: The first randomized trial in RR-ES has shown that high-dose ifosfamide is more effective in prolonging survival than TC, having previously beaten GD and IT, and should be considered as a control arm in future randomized phase II/III studies in RR-ES if combination with IFOS is logical. rEECur is the first study to provide comparative toxicity and survival data for the four most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in RR-ES.

T-DXd has shown promising efficacy in HER2-low mBC in a phase 1 study (NCT02564900; Modi2020). This is the primary report from DESTINY-Breast04 (NCT03734029), the first randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study comparing efficacy and safety of T-DXd vs TPC in pts with HER2-low mBC treated with 1-2 prior lines of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Methods: 557 pts with centrally confirmed HER2-low mBC were randomly assigned 2:1 to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) in pts with hormone receptor–positive (HR+) mBC. Key secondary endpoints (hierarchically tested after the primary endpoint) include PFS by BICR in the full analysis set (FAS; HR+/−) and overall survival (OS) in pts with HR+ mBC and in FAS. Other endpoints were objective response rate, duration of response, safety, and an exploratory analysis of pts with HR− mBC. Results: As of Jan 11, 2022, 373 and 184 pts (88.7% and 88.6% HR+ mBC) were assigned to T-DXd and TPC, respectively. Median follow-up was 18.4 months (mo; 95% CI, 17.9-19.1). Median treatment duration was 8.2 mo (range, 0.2-33.3) with T-DXd and 3.5 mo (range, 0.3-17.6) with TPC. Efficacy results are in the Table. 52.6% of pts with T-DXd vs. 67.4% of pts with TPC had grade (G) ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). With T-DXd, 45 pts (12.1%; 10.0% G1/2, 1.3% G3/4, 0.8% G5) had independently adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease [ILD]/pneumonitis vs. 1 pt (0.6% G1) with TPC.

The IFM 2009 trial, which used R maintenance for 1 year (y), showed progression-free survival (PFS; median, 35.0 vs. 47.3 months [mos]) but no overall survival benefit (OS; 60 vs. 62% at 8 y; median follow-up, 89.8 mos) with RVd + ASCT vs. RVd alone in the setting of multiple effective options at relapse, including ASCT at first relapse in 77% of pts (Attal M et\\xa0al, N Engl J Med 2017; Perrot A et\\xa0al, ASH 2020). We report primary data from our US DETERMINATION trial, which used R maintenance until progression. Methods: Pts with NDMM aged 18-65 y were randomly assigned to receive 3 RVd cycles, stem cell mobilization, and then 5 more RVd cycles (Arm A) or IV melphalan 200 mg/m2 + ASCT and 2 RVd cycles (Arm B). Each 21-d RVd cycle comprised PO R 25 mg (d 1-14), IV/SC bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 (d 1, 4, 8, 11), and PO dexamethasone 20/10 mg (cycles 1-3/≥ 4; d 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12). Both arms received R 10-15 mg/d maintenance until progression or intolerance. The primary endpoint was PFS (90% power to detect PFS hazard ratio [HR] of 1.43 [Arm A vs. B] with α = 0.05 on stratified two-sided log-rank test; full information: 329 events in 720 pts). Data cut-off was Dec 10, 2021. Results: 357 and 365 pts were randomly assigned to Arms A and B, respectively; median age was 57 and 55 y, 14% and 13% had ISS stage III MM, and 18% each had high-risk cytogenetics [t(4;14), t(14;16), del17p]. In the respective arms, 291 and 290 pts received R maintenance for a median duration of 36 and 41 mos. After median follow-up of 76 mos and 328 events, median PFS was 46.2 vs. 67.6 mos in Arm A vs. B (HR 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.91; p < .0001). Best responses in pts assessed to date were 52 vs. 62% ≥ CR (p = .006), 79 vs. 83% ≥ VGPR and 94 vs. 96% ≥ PR; in 251 evaluable pts, rate of MRD negativity (10-5) was 37.3 vs. 52.1% (p = .021) within 1 y of maintenance. 63 vs. 53% of pts have received subsequent treatment; of Arm A, 22% had ASCT as first non-protocol therapy. With 90 vs. 88 pts having died in Arm A vs. B, 4-y OS was 84% (95% CI, 80–88%) vs. 85% (95% CI, 81–88%); HR 1.10 (95% CI, 0.81–1.47; p = .274). Grade ≥ 3 related adverse events were less common in Arm A vs. B (78 vs. 94%; hematologic: 61 vs. 90%, p < .0001); 10 vs. 11% had secondary malignancies (ALL, 7 vs. 3 pts, p = .22; AML/MDS, 0 vs. 10 pts, p = .002). Difference in mean change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status score was < 10 points throughout treatment except at RVd cycle 5 vs. post-ASCT (compliance rate, 75% vs. 55%; mean change +3.0 vs. –11.1; p < .0001). Whole-genome sequencing, additional QOL, and correlative analyses are ongoing. Conclusions: RVd ± ASCT and R maintenance to progression resulted in the longest median PFS reported for each approach, and a highly significant 21.4-mo gain in median PFS benefit using RVd + ASCT.

       "  'LBA5Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical resection of the rectum is a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. A subset of rectal cancer is mismatch repair deficient. Since mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer is responsive to PD-1 blockade in the metastatic setting, we hypothesized that locally advanced mismatch repair deficient rectal cancer is sensitive to checkpoint blockade and may alter the requirements for chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Methods: We conducted a prospective phase II study in which single agent dostarlimab, an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was administered every 3 weeks for 6 months in patients with mismatch repair deficient stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma, to be followed by standard chemoradiation and surgery. Patients who achieved a clinical complete response were eligible for omission of chemoradiation and surgery. Results: Twelve patients initiated treatment and have at least 6 months of follow up. All 12 (100%, 95% CI:74%-100%) achieved a clinical complete response with no evidence of tumor on MRI, FDG-PET, endoscopic visualization, digital rectal exam, or biopsy, which satisfied the study’s co-primary endpoint. To date, no patients have required chemoradiation or surgery, and no cases of progression or recurrence have been noted during follow up (range 6-25 months). No serious adverse events > grade 3 were observed. Conclusions: Mismatch repair deficient locally advanced rectal cancer is exceptionally sensitive to single agent PD-1 blockade. Longer follow up is needed to assess response duration. Clinical trial information: NCT04165772.',\n",

       "  'LBA100Background: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in stage II colon cancer continues to be debated. The presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after surgery predicts very poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), while its absence predicts a low recurrence risk. For ctDNA-positive cases the benefit of adjuvant CT is unknown. DYNAMIC was designed to assess if a ctDNA-guided approach could reduce the use of adjuvant CT without compromising recurrence risk. Methods: DYNAMIC is a multi-center randomized controlled phase II trial. Eligible patients had resected stage II colon cancer and were suitable for adjuvant CT. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to ctDNA-guided management or standard management (clinician-guided based on conventional criteria), after stratification for T stage and participating center location. Criteria for clinical low versus high risk were predefined. The Safe-SeqS tumor-informed personalized ctDNA assay was used. For ctDNA-guided management, a ctDNA-positive result at 4 or 7 weeks after surgery prompted oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine CT; ctDNA-negative patients were not treated. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority in RFS rate at 2 years. A key secondary endpoint was adjuvant CT use. The target sample size of 450 provided 80% power with 95% confidence to confirm non-inferiority between the two arms with a margin of 8.5%. Results: Of 455 patients randomized between Aug 2015 and Aug 2019, 302 were assigned to ctDNA-guided and 153 to standard management. Median follow-up was 37 months. In the ctDNA-guided arm, ctDNA analysis was successful in all but three patients; only two patients did not receive ctDNA-guided management. In the intention to treat population, fewer patients overall in the ctDNA-guided arm received adjuvant CT compared to standard management (15.3% vs 27.9%, odds ratio 2.14; P = 0.002), with the largest difference seen in patients with T4 or poorly differentiated tumors (odds ratios 6.22 and 6.31, respectively). Of those who received treatment, oxaliplatin-based doublet was more frequently administered than fluoropyrimidine alone for ctDNA-guided compared to standard management patients (62.2% vs. 9.8%; P < 0.001). ctDNA-guided management was non-inferior to standard management for 2-year RFS (93.5% vs 92.4%, difference 1.1%, 95% confidence interval, -4.1% to 6.2%). Following adjuvant CT, 3-year RFS for ctDNA-positive patients was 86.4%. Without adjuvant CT, 3-year RFS for ctDNA-negative patients was 92.5%, with a 3-year RFS of 96.7% in the clinical low risk subgroup. Conclusions: A ctDNA-guided approach to stage II colon cancer reduced adjuvant chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival. The low recurrence rate in ctDNA-positive patients who received chemotherapy suggests a survival benefit from adjuvant therapy. ctDNA-negative patients are unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy.

       "  'LBA501Background: Adjuvant breast RT is usually prescribed following BCS to reduce the risk of local recurrence (LR). However, this treatment is inconvenient, costly, and associated with acute and late toxicity. Traditional clinical pathological factors (CPFs) alone are limited in their ability to identify women with a low enough risk of LR to omit RT. Molecular defined intrinsic subtypes of BC provide additional prognostic information with luminal A having the lowest risk of recurrence. A retrospective analysis of a previous trial suggested that women >60 years with luminal A grade 1-2 T1N0 BC treated by BCS and endocrine therapy alone had a low rate of LR (JCO 2015; 33:2035). The utility of identifying luminal A subtype combined with CPFs has not been prospectively evaluated for its ability to guide RT decision-making. Methods: A prospective multicenter cohort study was performed. Eligibility criteria were: women ≥ 55 years; having undergone BCS for grade 1-2 T1N0 BC; ≥ 1mm margins of excision; luminal A subtype (defined as: ER ≥ 1%, PR>20%, HER2 negative and Ki67 ≤ 13.25%); and treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy. ER, PR and HER2 were performed locally as per ASCO guidelines. Patients meeting clinical eligibility with ER ≥ 1%, PR>20%, HER2 negative BC were registered and had Ki67 immunohistochemistry performed centrally in one of three Canadian laboratories using International Ki67 Working Group methods. Proficiency testing between laboratories was performed yearly. Patients with Ki67 ≤ 13.25% were enrolled in the trial and were assigned to not receive RT. The primary outcome was LR defined as time from enrollment to any invasive or non-invasive cancer in the ipsilateral breast. Assuming a 5-year LR rate of 3.5%, 500 patients were required to show that the upper bound of a two sided 90% (one-sided 95%) confidence interval (CI) was <5%. Patients were followed every six months for the first two years and then yearly. The probability of LR was estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death as a competing risk. Secondary outcomes were contralateral BC; relapse free survival (RFS) based on any recurrence; disease free survival (DFS) based on any recurrence, second cancer or death; and overall survival (OS). Results: From August 2013 to July 2017, 501 of 727 registered patients from 26 centers had a Ki67 ≤ 13.25% and were enrolled. Median follow-up was 5 years. Median age was 67 and 442 (88%) patients were <75 years. Median tumor size was 1.1 cm. The 5-year rate of LR satisfied our pre-specified boundary (see Table). Conclusions: Women ≥ 55 years with grade 1-2 T1N0 luminal A BC following BCS treated with endocrine therapy alone had very low rates of LR at 5 years and are candidates for omission of RT.

       "  'LBA511Background: TX05 is being developed as a biosimilar to trastuzumab. We previously reported results of a Phase III study (TX05-03) comparing the efficacy and safety of TX05 to originator trastuzumab (TRA) in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer (EBC). The rate of pathologic complete response for subjects treated with TX05 compared to TRA in the TX05-03 study were within pre-defined equivalence margins, supporting the therapeutic equivalence of TX05 and TRA. This is an extension study to further assess and characterize the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of TX05 and TRA as single agents. Methods: TX05-03e was a randomized double-blinded, parallel group Phase III trial with patients enrolled at 82 centers in 10 countries. Adjuvant treatment included single agent trastuzumab (TX05 or TRA) for up to thirteen 3-week cycles. Subjects originally assigned to TX05 in the neoadjuvant phase of treatment received TX05, while subjects randomized to TRA in the neoadjuvant phase were randomized (1:1) to receive either TX05 or TRA. Efficacy endpoints include assessment of disease-free survival and overall survival. DFS is defined as the time from randomization in the neoadjuvant study (Protocol TX05-03) to the documentation of a first failure. OS is defined as the time from randomization in the neoadjuvant study until death from any cause. Safety parameters assessed include treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and serious adverse events (SAE), death, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, 12-Lead ECG, LVEF and Physical examination. Immunogenicity was also assessed. Results: Of the 338 subjects randomized, 256 received TX05 while 82 received TRA. 81 of the TX05 patients received TRA in the neoadjuvant treatment phase. Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the three arms (TX05/TX05, TRA/TRA, or TRA/TX05 in neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment phases). There was one death reported (TRA/TX05 group due to disease progression). DFS events occurred in only 3.4% of the TX05/TX05 group, 6.1% of the TRA/TRA group and 3.7% of the TRA/TX05 group. The number of subjects with any AE was 53.1% in the TX05/TX05, 56.1% in the TRA/TRA group and 37% in the TRA/TX05 groups. Frequency, type and severity of adverse events related to study drug were similar between the three groups and no new safety signals were detected. Conclusions: The rates of DFS, OS, AEs and immunogenicity were comparable in subjects randomized to TX05/TX05, TRA/TRA or TRA/TX05 for neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment and continue to support the conclusion of biosimilarity of TX05 to the reference product. The change from TRA to TX05 for adjuvant treatment has no detectable impact on safety or treatment outcome. Clinical trial information: NCT04109391.',\n",

It was demonstrated that GLSI-100 safely elicited a potent immune response versus placebo, along with data showing ISRs correlate to immune response data such as Delayed Type Hypersensitivity (DTH). Methods: Patients were randomized and received GLSI-100 (500 mcg GP2: 125 mcg GM-CSF) or control (GM-CSF) via 6 intradermal injections every 3-4 weeks as part of the Primary Immunization Series (PIS) for 6 months and 4 booster injections every 6 months thereafter. Injection site reactions were assessed 48-72 hours after the injection. Booster injections were introduced mid-trial so not all patients were dosed with boosters. The largest perpendicular diameters of induration were measured, and the orthogonal mean was calculated to quantify ISRs, providing potential assessments of peak and nadir immunity during the PIS and booster phases of treatment. Results: The study enrolled 180 patients who were HER2 3+ positive and low HER2 expressors (1-2+). After 5 years of follow-up, the Kaplan-Meier estimated 5-year DFS rate in the 46 HER2 3+ patients treated with GLSI-100, who were in the efficacy population, was 100% versus 89.4% (95% CI:76.2, 95.5%) in the 50 patients treated with GM-CSF (p = 0.0338). A patient is in the efficacy population if they were treated, followed, and remained disease free over the first 6 months. Boosters were administered to 53 HER2 3+ patients (54%). The median peak ISR during the PIS in GLSI-100 treated patients was 92.1 mm versus 60.5 mm in the GM-CSF only treated control patients. Peak ISR in GLSI-100 treated patients occurred throughout the 10-dose dosing period, including during boosters. During the 6 dose PIS, 84% of the peak ISRs occurred between doses 3 through 6. Each booster is administered 6 months after the last injection, thus the booster ISR is likely measuring the nadir immune response. When comparing the peak ISR during PIS to the boosters, the nadir ISRs of the boosters were approximately 20 mm smaller. Conclusions: Administering GLSI-100 boosters at 6 month intervals to patients produced a consistent nadir ISR approximately 20 mm lower than the maximum PIS ISR of 92.1 mm which is still larger than the maximum ISR in GM-CSF only patients of 60.5 mm. A patient’s immune response a month after booster dosing would theoretically be the peak ISR, which will be measured in future trials by measuring T-cell response and DTH one month after booster injections, further helping to evaluate booster strategies to sustain peak immunity over longer periods of time.

       "  'LBA1001Background: HR+/HER2– disease is the most common subtype of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Treatment includes sequential endocrine therapy combined with targeted agents followed by single-agent chemotherapy, with increasingly shorter durations of benefit. SG is an anti–Trop-2 antibody-drug conjugate approved for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer with ≥2 prior therapies (≥1 for MBC). The HR+/HER2– MBC cohort of the phase 1/2 IMMU-132-01 study (n = 54) had an objective response rate (ORR) of 31.5%, median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.5 mo, median overall survival (OS) of 12 mo, and a manageable safety profile with SG. TROPiCS-02 is a phase 3 randomized study (NCT03901339) to confirm SG outcomes in HR+/HER2– advanced breast cancer. Methods: Adults with locally determined, HR+/HER2– unresectable locally advanced or MBC, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 2-4 prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC were eligible; 1 prior therapy for MBC was allowed if disease progressed ≤12 mo after (neo)adjuvant therapy. Pts must have received ≥1 prior taxane, CDK4/6 inhibitor, and endocrine therapy in any setting. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive SG (10 mg/kg IV on d1 and 8, every 21d) or TPC (capecitabine, eribulin, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was PFS per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (final analysis) with key secondary endpoint of OS (1st planned interim analysis). Results: At data cutoff on Jan 3, 2022, 272 vs 271 pts were randomized to receive SG vs TPC, respectively. Pt characteristics in the SG vs TPC arms were similar (3 median prior chemotherapy regimens for MBC [range, 0-8]; 95% had visceral metastases, 86% had prior endocrine therapy for MBC for ≥6 mo, 60% and 38% received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors for ≤12 and > 12 mo, respectively). SG (vs TPC) improved median PFS (5.5 vs 4.0 mo; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.83; P= 0.0003); PFS rates at 6 and 12 mo were 46% vs 30% and 21% vs 7%, respectively. SG vs TPC showed a numeric but nonsignificant difference in OS (13.9 vs 12.3 mo; HR, 0.84; P= 0.143); ORR (21% vs 14%) and clinical benefit rate (34% vs 22%) were higher with SG vs TPC and median duration of response was 7.4 vs 5.6 mo, respectively. Overall, 74% vs 60% of patients (SG vs TPC) had grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs); neutropenia (51% vs 39%) and diarrhea (10% vs 1%) were most common. AEs leading to discontinuation of SG vs TPC were low (6% vs 4%). There was 1 treatment-related death in the SG arm; none in the TPC arm. Conclusions: SG had a statistically significant, clinically meaningful PFS benefit over single-agent chemotherapy and a manageable safety profile in pts with heavily pre-treated HR+/HER2– endocrine-resistant, unresectable locally advanced or MBC, who have limited treatment options.

       "  'LBA1003Background: PAL was the first cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor approved for ER+/HER2– ABC based on the randomized, phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. PALOMA-2 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial in first-line ER+/HER2– ABC that confirmed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with PAL+LET versus PBO+LET (median PFS, 27.6 vs 14.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.46–0.69]; P<0.0001). At the time of the final PFS analysis, OS data were not mature. Herein, we report OS results. Methods: 666 postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2– ABC who had not received prior systemic therapy for advanced disease were randomized 2:1 to receive PAL (125 mg/d orally, 3/1 week schedule) plus LET (2.5 mg/d orally, continuously) or PBO+LET. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS and a key secondary endpoint was OS. Per study design, 390 OS events are required to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio <0.74 at a significance level of 0.025 (1-sided) using a stratified log-rank test. The planned final OS analysis was conducted when the number of events required for the analysis was observed. Results: At data cut-off (November 15, 2021), with a median follow-up of 90 months, 43 patients (pts; 10%) remained on PAL+LET and 5 pts (2%) on PBO+LET. With 405 deaths, median OS (95% CI) was 53.9 months (49.8–60.8) in the PAL+LET arm and 51.2 months (43.7 –58.9) in the PBO+LET arm (hazard ratio, 0.956 [95% CI, 0.777–1.177]; stratified 1-sided P=0.3378). In this OS analysis, a proportion of pts were not available for follow-up (withdrew consent or lost to follow-up) and were censored: 21% in the PBO+LET arm versus 13% in the PAL+LET arm. A posthoc sensitivity analysis excluding these pts resulted in a median OS (95% CI) of 51.6 months (46.9–57.1) with PAL+LET and 44.6 months (37.0–52.3) with PBO+LET (hazard ratio, 0.869 [95% CI, 0.706–1.069]). Of the pts who discontinued study treatment, 81% in the PAL+LET arm and 88% in the PBO+LET arm received post-study systemic therapy; 12% and 27% of pts who discontinued received CDK4/6 inhibitor, respectively. In pts with disease-free interval (DFI) >12 months, median OS (95% CI) was 66.3 months (52.1–79.7) in the PAL+LET arm (n=179) and 47.4 months (37.7–57.0) in the PBO+LET arm (n=93); hazard ratio, 0.728 (95% CI, 0.528-1.005). No new safety findings were observed. Conclusions: PALOMA-2 met its primary endpoint of improving PFS but not the secondary endpoint of OS. Pts receiving PAL+LET had numerically longer OS compared to PBO+LET, but the results were not statistically significant.

       "  'LBA1004Background: CDK 4/6i has demonstrated benefit in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in pts with HR+, HER2- MBC when combined with endocrine therapy (ET). While observational data demonstrate a potential benefit of continuing CDK 4/6i and switching ET at progression, no prospective trials have evaluated this approach. We conducted a phase II, multi-center, randomized, trial to evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib in pts with HR+HER2- MBC whose cancer previously progressed on any CDK 4/6i + any ET. Methods: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, men or women with measurable or non-measurable HR+/HER2- MBC whose cancer progressed during CDK 4/6i and ET were randomized 1:1 to fulvestrant or exemestane +/- ribociclib. Pts treated with prior fulvestrant received exemestane as ET in the randomization; if prior exemestane fulvestrant was the ET; if neither, fulvestrant or exemestane was per investigator discretion, though fulvestrant was encouraged. PFS was the primary endpoint, defined as time from randomization to progression of disease or death. A one-sided log-rank test with a sample size of 120 randomized and evaluable pts with a significance level alpha of 2.5%, achieves 80% power to detect an effect size (difference in PFS) of 3 months. Results: Of the 120 randomized evaluable pts, 1 pt was removed due to not taking ET along with ribociclib/placebo. All but 1 pt was female, the median age was 57.0 years, 88 pts (74%) were white, and 21 (17.6%) were Hispanic. For ET, 99 pts received fulvestrant (83%) and 20 pts exemestane (17%). In terms of prior CDK 4/6i, 100 pts previously received palbociclib (84%), 13 pribociclib (11%), 2 abemaciclib (2%), and 4 palbociclib and another CDK 4/6i (3%). There was a statistically significant PFS improvement for pts randomized to fulvestrant or exemestane + ribociclib [median: 5.33 months, 95% CI (Confidence Interval): 3.25–8.12 months] vs. placebo (median: 2.76 months, 95% CI: 2.66–3.25 months): Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37-0.83), p = 0.004. Similar results were seen in the subset of pts treated with fulvestrant, with a median PFS for those randomized to ribociclib (5.29 months) vs. placebo (2.76 months), HR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38-0.91), p = 0.02. At 6 months, 42% were progression-free on the ribociclib arm vs. 24% on placebo. At 12 months, 25% were progression-free on the ribociclib arm vs. 7% on placebo. Additional endpoints will be reported, including overall response rate and safety. Conclusions: In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, there was a significant PFS benefit for pts with HR+/HER2- MBC to switch ET and receive ribociclib after progression on CDK 4/6i.

       "  'LBA2002Background: LGG is the most common pediatric brain cancer, and BRAF V600 mutation has been detected in ≈17% of cases. Most patients (pts) with pLGG have disease progression and require post-surgical therapy. The standard of care is chemotherapy, such as carboplatin + vincristine (C+V), which may be less effective in BRAF V600–mutant disease; thus, alternative treatment options are needed. Dab + tram showed encouraging efficacy in a Phase I/II study (NCT02124772) in pts with previously treated BRAF V600–mutant pLGG. We describe the results of a randomized Phase II study (NCT02684058) of first-line dab + tram vs C+V in BRAF V600–mutant pLGG. Methods: Pts aged 1 to <18 y with BRAF V600 mutation–positive gliomas and Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥50% were enrolled. In the pLGG cohort, pts with progressive disease after surgery or nonsurgical pts requiring systemic treatment were randomized (2:1) to receive either dab twice daily (<12 y, 5.25 mg/kg/d; ≥12 y, 4.5 mg/kg/d) + tram once daily (<6 y, 0.032 mg/kg/d; ≥6 y, 0.025 mg/kg/d) or C+V (standard dosing). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR; independent review, RANO criteria). Secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed ORR, clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety. Results: A total of 110 pts were randomized to receive dab + tram (n=73) or C+V (n=37); 4 pts in the C+V arm withdrew before treatment. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms. At data cutoff (August 23, 2021; median follow-up, 18.9 mo), 61 pts (84%) in the dab + tram arm and 8 (22%) in the C+V arm remained on treatment; in the C+V arm, 9 completed planned treatment and 16 discontinued before completion. The primary endpoint was met: the independently assessed ORR (CR+PR) was 47% (95% CI, 35%-59%) with dab + tram vs 11% (95% CI, 3%-25%) with C+V (P<.001; odds ratio, 7.2 [95% CI, 2.3-22.4]), and the clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD ≥24 wk) was 86% (95% CI, 76%-93%) vs 46% (95% CI, 30%-63%). Median PFS was 20.1 mo (95% CI, 12.8 mo-not estimable) with dab + tram vs 7.4 mo (95% CI, 3.6-11.8 mo) with C+V (P<.001; HR, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.17-0.55]); 12-mo Kaplan-Meier PFS rates were 67% vs 26%. There were no deaths in the dab + tram arm and 1 in the C+V arm due to LGG. Pts in the dab + tram arm had fewer grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs; 47% vs 94%) and fewer discontinuations due to AEs (4% vs 18%) than pts in the C+V arm. The most frequent AEs in the dab + tram vs chemotherapy arms were pyrexia (68% vs 18%), headache (47% vs 27%), and vomiting (34% vs 48%). Conclusions: Dab + tram significantly increased ORR and CBR and prolonged PFS compared with C+V in pts with BRAF V600 mutation–positive pLGG. These encouraging results and the tolerable safety profile suggest that dab + tram may be a promising first-line systemic treatment option for this pt population.

       "  'LBA3505Background: The association of a chemotherapy doublet (FOLFOX/FOLFIRI) with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) is an upfront option for the treatment of RAS and BRAF wt mCRC patients. Phase II studies investigating the combination of the triplet FOLFOXIRI with an anti-EGFR reported promising activity results and an acceptable safety profile when lower doses of 5FU and irinotecan were adopted. The added value of intensifying the upfront chemotherapy when combined with a targeted agent in a molecularly selected population is not established. Methods: TRIPLETE is a prospective, open label, phase III trial in which previously untreated patients with unresectable RAS and BRAF wt mCRC were randomized to receive mFOLFOX6/pan (arm A) or mFOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/sqm, oxaliplatin 85 mg/sqm, L-leucovorin 200 mg/sqm, 5-fluoruracil 2400 mg/sqm 48 h infusion)/pan (arm B) up to 12 cycles, followed by 5FU/LV/pan until disease progression. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary endpoints include safety profile, R0 resection rate, PFS and OS. Under the assumption of an ORR of 60% in arm A, to detect an increase of at least 15% in arm B, a sample size of 432 cases provided approximately 90% power to a two-sided chi square test for heterogeneity at the 0.05 significance level. Results: From September 2017 to September 2021, 435 pts were enrolled (arm A/B: 217/218) in 67 Italian sites. Main pts’ characteristics were (arm A/B): median age 59/59, ECOG PS 0 80%/84%, left-sided 88%/88%, synchronous metastases 88%/87%, prior adjuvant 2%/6%, resected primary 43%/51%, liver-only 37%/39%. Main grade > 2 adverse events were diarrhoea 7%/23%, stomatitis 7%/7%, neutropenia 20%/32%, febrile neutropenia 3%/6%, fatigue 2%/7%, skin rash 29%/19%. 160 (73%) out of 218 patients in arm B and 165 (76%) out of 217 patients in arm A achieved RECIST response (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.56-1.34, p=0.526). No interaction effect between treatment arm and disease spread (liver-limited vs not-liver limited) was evident. No differences in early tumor shrinkage (arm A/B 58%/57%, p=0.878) and deepness of response (median arm A/B: 47%/48%, p=0.845) were reported, nor in R0 resection rate (arm A/B 29%/25%, p=0.317). At a median follow up of 26.5 mos, 305 (arm A/B: 157/148) PFS events were collected, with no significant difference between arms (median PFS: 12.7 vs 12.3 months, HR: 0.88, 95%CI 0.70-1.11, p=0.277). Conclusions: The intensification of the upfront chemotherapy backbone in combination with panitumumab in molecularly selected and mostly (88%) left-sided mCRC patients does not provide any benefit in terms of treatment activity at the price of a non-negligible increase in gastrointestinal toxicity.

       "  'LBA3506Background: Patients (pts) with initially unresectable CRLM may qualify for curative-intent local therapy after downsizing by induction systemic therapy. The CAIRO5 study aims to find the optimal induction regimen. We present the results of pts with right-sided and/or RAS/BRAFV600E mutated primary tumors. Accrual in pts with left-sided and RAS/BRAFV600E wildtype tumors is ongoing. Methods: Pts were randomized between FOLFOX or FOLFIRI + bevacizumab (B) (arm A) and FOLFOXIRI-B (arm B), in both arms up to 12 cycles and followed by 5FU/LV/B maintenance. Prior systemic or local therapy for metastases was not allowed. Unresectability of CRLM at baseline was assessed by an online liver expert panel of surgeons and radiologists based on predefined criteria, and resectability every 2 months thereafter based on panel majority vote. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were R0/1 resection, overall survival, overall response rate (ORR), toxicity, pathologic response, postoperative morbidity and correlation of panel evaluations with outcome. Pts were stratified by potentially resectable vs permanently unresectable CRLM, serum LDH (normal/abnormal), BRAFV600E mutation, sidedness, choice of irinotecan vs oxaliplatin and institute. To detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 for PFS with 80% power and a 2-sided log-rank test at 5%, 257 events were required, assuming a median PFS of 8.7 months for arm A. Results: From December 2014 until March 2021, 294 pts were randomized, 148 in arm A and 146 in arm B in 43 Dutch and 1 Belgian sites. 3 ineligible pts were excluded. Median follow up was 40 months. Pts received a median of 10 vs 9 induction cycles in arm A vs B. Main characteristics were (arm A/B): median age 61/65 years, male 63.9/60.4%, right-sided primary tumor 39.5/41.7%, RAS mutant 85.7/86.1%, BRAFV600E mutant 6.8/8.3%, synchronous disease 86.4/89.6%, prior adjuvant chemotherapy 4.8/4.9%, median number of CRLM 12/12. With 259 events, median PFS in arm A vs B was 9.0 vs 10.6 months (stratified HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.96, p=0.02). ORR was 32.0% vs 52.1% (p<0.001), any grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 58.5% vs 75.0% (p=0.003), the most frequent were neutropenia (12.9/38.2%, p<0.001), hypertension (14.3/13.9%, p=1) and diarrhea (3.4/19.4%, p<0.001) in arm A vs B, respectively. R0/1 resection ± ablation rates were 37.4% vs 51.4% (p=0.02) with 2-stage procedures in 16.4% vs 32.4% (p=0.04), postoperative complications occurred in 38.2% vs 51.2% (p=0.14), Clavien Dindo grade ≥3 in 14.7% vs 26.8% (p=0.08). Conclusions: FOLFOXIRI-B vs FOLFOX/FOLFIRI-B significantly increases PFS, ORR and R0/1 resections at the cost of increased toxicity in pts with initially unresectable CRLM and right-sided and/or RAS/BRAFV600E mutated primary tumor.

       "  'LBA3507Background: Systemic chemotherapy improves survival of patients with stage IV colon cancer who are no candidates for curative therapy. However, it has remained controversial, if primary tumor resection prior to chemotherapy further prolongs survival of these patients. We report the combined results of the SYNCHRONOUS and CCRe-IV trial, comparing primary tumor resection followed by systemic chemotherapy to systemic chemotherapy alone in stage IV colon cancer patients. Methods: The SYNCHRONOUS trial (ISRCTN30964555) is a multicentre, randomized, controlled, superiority trial with a two-group parallel design. Colon cancer patients with synchronous unresectable metastases were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were primary tumor-related symptoms, inability to tolerate surgery and/or systemic chemotherapy and history of another primary cancer. Resection of the primary tumor as well as systemic chemotherapy was provided according to the standards of the participating institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) with a minimum follow-up of 36 months (ITT population). An interim analysis yielded a pooled median survival time of 18 months. Assuming a difference of 6 months in median survival (15 vs. 21 months) with a two-sided type I error of 5%, power of 80% and an additional recruitment of 15% the total sample size amounted to n=392 patients (n=196 per arm). In order to accelerate reporting of the primary endpoint, data were pooled with the Spanish CCRe-IV trial (NCT02015923) with similar eligibility criteria, interventions and endpoints. Results: Between September 2011 and March 2013, 393 patients were randomized to primary tumor resection before chemotherapy (PTR; n=187) or chemotherapy alone (CTX; n=206) at 100 centers. The final study cohort included n=295 (75.1%) patients from the SYNCHRONOUS trial and n=98 (24.9%) patients from the CCRe-IV trial. The median follow-up was 36.7 months (95% CI: 36.6-37.3). Median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI: 13.2-19.2) in the PTR arm and 18.6 months (95% CI: 16.2-22.3) in the CTX arm. On final analysis, there was no significant difference for OS (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.743-1.215; p-value: 0.685), based on a proportional hazard model (shaired frailty). A total of 45 (24.1%) and 13 (6.4%) patients did not receive any chemotherapy in the PTR and CTX arm, respectively. In line with these data, the number of serious adverse events (excluding postoperative complications) was not different in the CTX arm (44; 20.7%) compared with the PTR arm (24; 12.5%). Conclusions: Resection of the primary tumor before chemotherapy does not prolong OS in patients with newly diagnozed, stage IV colon cancer and synchronous unresectable metastases.

       "  'LBA3513Background: The combination of capecitabine plus long course radiotherapy (RT) is the standard preoperative therapy in cT3-4 cN+ rectal cancer. pathologic complete remission (pCR) can be considered as surrogate endpoint of efficacy of treatment in terms of disease-free survival (DFS). Preclinical data points heavily toward a strong synergy between RT and immune treatments. Methods: This is a prospective phase II, open label, single arm, multicentre study in patient with locally advanced rectal cancer who receive standard concomitant CT/RT therapy (825 mg/m2 twice daily capecitabine every day and 5040 cGy radiotherapy for 5 days per week for 5 weeks) followed by durvalumab (1500 mg Q4W for 3 administrations). Surgery is performed after 10-12 weeks from neoadjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint is the proportion of pCRs after at least 1 cycle of durvalumab; secondary endpoints are the proportion of clinical complete remissions (cCRs) after at least 1 cycle of durvalumab, the proportion of adverse and serious adverse events (NCI CTCAE v5.0). The sample size has been estimated by using the optimal Simon’s two-stage design assuming a null pCR proportion of 0.15 and an alternative pCR percentage of 0.30 (alpha = 0.05, power = 0.80). If more than 4 pCRs were observed in the first 19 enrolled patients, 36 additional patients were to be accrued for a total of 55 evaluable patients. The null hypothesis is rejected if ≥ 13 pCRs are observed in 55 patients. Results: Between November 2019 and August 2021, 60 patients were accrued, of which 55 were evaluable for study objectives. Fifty-two of 55 treated patients received all 3 infusions of durvalumab. After treatment, a clinical response percentage of 81.8% was observed; 3 patients had progression of disease due to local and/or metastases before surgical intervention. Eighteen patients achieved complete pathological response (32.7%), confirmed by central revision. Near complete regression, moderate and minimal regression were observed in 14 (25.5%), 9 (16.4%) and 11 (20.0%) patients respectively. Regarding toxicity, 23 patients (41.8%) had adverse events (AEs) related to durvalumab treatment. Two patients (1.8%) discontinued durvalumab for toxicity. Grade 3 AEs occurred in 4 (7.3%) patients (diarrhea, skin toxicity, transaminase increase, lipase increase and pancolitis). No Grade 4 toxicity was observed. In 20 patients (36.4%) G1-2 AEs related to durvalumab were observed. The most common were endocrine toxicity (hyper/hypo-thyroidism), dermatologic toxicity (skin rash) and gastrointestinal toxicity (transaminase increase, nausea, diarrhea, constipation). Conclusions: This study met its primary endpoint showing a promising activity of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy plus durvalumab in terms of pCR rate and a safe toxicity profile.

       "  'LBA3514Background: Organ preserving treatment strategies based on chemoradiotherapy may spare rectal cancer patients of major surgery and stoma. We suggest substantially improved tumor control by increasing the radiotherapy dose, without significant increase in the rate of late effects. We designed a prospective phase II trial to test high-dose radiotherapy of low rectal cancer for organ preservation in a multicenter setting. Methods: We enrolled patients with localized T1-3 N0-1 M0 rectal cancer within 6 cm from the anal verge and in performance status 0-2. Any N1-nodes had to be at the level of the tumor and included in the primary tumor-volume. Radiotherapy consisted of 62 Gy to the tumor and 50.4 Gy to the regional lymph nodes, delivered in 28 fractions using intensity modulated radiation therapy and daily image guidance. Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID. Patients with clinical complete response (cCR) 6–12 weeks after end of treatment were allocated to follow-up. Surgery was offered only in case of residual cancer or later re-growth. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with locoregional tumor control after two years by chemoradiation alone. Secondary endpoints included long-term side effects (CTCAE grading), cCR, rate of distant metastases, and overall survival. Results: Three Danish centers enrolled 107 patients between 2015 and 2019. Baseline classifications were T1/T2/T3 and N1 in 15%/54%/31% and 29%, respectively. The median age was 71 years and 64% were male. 92 (86.0%) had cCR and were allocated to observation. Four patients drew consent or died leaving 103 observed for at least 2 years. 23 had regrowth after cCR, five of whom had organ preserving transanal endoscopic microsurgery, 15 other curative surgery, and three palliation. 63 had no locoregional regrowth. Thus 61% (63/103) of patients with 2 years of follow-up had locoregional tumor control with chemoradiation alone. The actuarial estimate of locoregional control at 2 years from start of observation was 73.8% (95%CI 63.2-81.8). Calculated from time of enrollment, metastasis-free and overall survival at 30 months was 85.4% (95%CI 76.5-91.1) and 94.8% (95%CI 87.8-97.8). In the 63 patients with complete response at 2 years, ‘Low Anterior Resection Syndrome-score’ was None=37%, Minor=28%, and Major=35%. The most severe toxicity was erectile dysfunction grade 3 (n=3), grade 2 (n=4), grade 1 (n=6), and grade 0 (n=26). Grade 2 diarrhea, constipation, fecal incontinence, rectal bleeding and decreased libido were each reported in one case, while urinary frequency grade 2 was seen in four patients. Conclusions: The vast majority of patients with low rectal cancer can be cured by modern radiotherapy 62 Gy in 28 fractions with excellent patient-reported outcomes, toxicity, tumor control, and survival. The treatment is feasible in a multicenter setting. We suggest this approach as a standard of care option. Clinical trial information: NCT02438839.',\n",

       "  'LBA4011Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies diagnosed at an advanced stage, and current treatment regimens are ineffective, with only 6-8 months of median overall survival (mOS). The present study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab (anti-EGFR humanized monoclonal antibody) combined with gemcitabine in K-Ras wild-type patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer were randomized to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg, every one week) followed by gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15, every four weeks), or placebo plus gemcitabine until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Use restricted mean survival time (RMST)-Log function to analyze the survival benefits when the proportional hazards assumption is untrue. Results: A total of 92 Chinese patients were randomly assigned to the nimotuzumab- gemcitabine (n = 46) or placebo-gemcitabine group (n = 46). In the full analysis set (FAS, n = 82), the mOS was significantly longer in the nimotuzumab-gemcitabine group (10.9 vs. 8.5 months, p = 0.025 by RMST-Log test, hazard ratio [HR], 0.50, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.94). The one-year survival rate was 43.6% in the nimotuzumab-gemicitabine group vs. 26.8% in the placebo-gemicitabine group, and 13.9% vs. 2.7% at three years. Subgroup analyses showed more survival benefit in patients without treatment of biliary obstruction (11.9 vs. 8.5 months, HR = 0.54, 95%CI 0.33-0.88, p = 0.037) and no surgical history (15.8 vs. 6.0 months, HR = 0.40, 95%CI 0.19-0.84). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 4.2 months in the nimotuzumab-gemicitabine group, as compared with 3.6 months in the placebo-gemicitabine group (HR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.99; p = 0.013 ); Patients without treatment of biliary obstruction had significantly longer PFS (5.5 vs. 3.4 months; p = 0.008 ). No statistical difference in the ORR between the two groups (p > 0.05). Nimotuzumab was safe and the incidence of adverse events in the nimotuzumab-gemicitabine group is similar to placbo-gemicitabine group. The most common grade 3 TRAEs in Nim-Gem group were neutropenia (11.1%), leukopenia (8.9%) and thrombocytopenia (6.7%). No grade 4 TRAEs. Conclusions: Nimotuzumab combined with gemcitabine increases OS and PFS in patients with K-Ras wild-type locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, particularly for those without treatment of biliary obstruction. The safety profile of nimotuzumab is similar to placebo. Clinical trial information: 02395016.',\n",

       "  'LBA4087Background: Upwards of 50% of patients who undergo gastrointestinal (GI) cancer surgery will not receive any chemotherapy due to the failure to heal from the surgery or its associated complications. Pre-operative exercise therapy (PEx) aims to optimize the medical and physical state of high-risk patients prior to undergoing surgery. Our group has shown PEx to be protective against the inflammatory injury caused by surgical stress in mice through a metabolic reprogramming towards an anti-inflammatory profile. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the utility of PEx among GI cancer patients undergoing surgery and how PEx impacts surgical outcomes. This study seeks to evaluate the mechanism behind PEx among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for GI cancer through a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Eligible patients diagnosed with GI cancers with planned abdominal surgery were randomized to receive PEx or no PEx between September 2020 and March 2022. PEx patients were evaluated by a physical therapist (PT) and prescribed a personalized training regimen based on objective assessments. Patient blood was drawn on the day of enrollment, day of surgery, then at 2 weeks and at 3 months following surgery. The primary endpoint is to investigate the mechanism behind the modulation of the inflammatory response of PEx among patients undergoing GI cancer surgery. Results: During an 18-month period, 30 patients were randomized to PEx and 35 randomized to non-PEx. Both cohorts were similar in age, gender, and comorbidity burden. Using patient serum samples, the secretome revealed a transcriptomic shift towards an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic phenotype in post-PEx patient blood samples when compared to pre-PEx and non-PEX patients. The secretome heatmap demonstrates significant changes post-PEX when compared to pre-PEx and non-PEX. Specifically, there was an upregulation of Esterase D protein (ESTD), Secreted Ly-6/uPAR-related protein 1 (SLUR1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and Phosphoinositide-3-kinase interacting protein 1 (P3IP1) which are associated with an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic phenotype. Moreover, there was a downregulation of pro-tumorigenic protein pathways including ankyrin 1 protein (ANK1), KIT protein, and Prolyl isomerase protein (PIN1). Additionally, gene ontology analysis used to evaluate differentially expressed proteins, revealed that proteins associated with lymphocyte mediated immunity were downregulated after PEx. Conclusion: Preoperative exercise may mitigate the pro-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic state of cancer by the upregulation and downregulation of specific cellular pathways. Data obtained from this study can be used to create a new class of therapeutics, exercise mimetics. Clinical trial information: NCT04602026.',\n",

       "  'LBA4500Background: Patients (pts) who undergo resection of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with curative intent remain at risk for disease relapse. We conducted a phase III, double-blind, placebo (PB)-controlled, intergroup study to determine the effect of adjuvant treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (EVE) on recurrence-free survival (RFS). Methods: Pts with treatment-naïve, non-metastatic, fully-resected RCC at intermediate high- (pT1 G3-4 N0 to pT3a G1-2 N0) or very high-risk (pT3a G3-4 to pT4 G-any or N+) for recurrence were randomized 1:1 to EVE 10 mg PO daily x 54 weeks or PB within 12 weeks of radical or partial nephrectomy. Randomization was stratified by risk group, histology (clear vs. non-clear cell), and performance status (0 vs. 1). RFS was the primary end point; secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). The study was designed to detect an 18% reduction in the risk of RFS with EVE compared to PB, corresponding to an improvement of median RFS from 6.75 (based on E2805 ASSURE) to 8.23 years. Final analysis, using a stratified logrank test, was to occur after 804 total events or by 3/2022, whichever occurred first. Results: Between 4/2011 and 9/2016, 1545 pts were randomized to EVE (n = 775) or PB (n = 770). Overall pt characteristics included: intermediate high-/very high-risk 45%/55%; clear cell/non-clear cell 83%/17%. The DSMC recommended study continuation after each of 4 pre-specified interim analyses. 556 DFS events among 1499 eligible pts occurred by the time of final study analysis on 2/23/2022. The median follow-up was 76 months. RFS was improved with EVE vs. PB (HR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.72 – 1.00; P1-sided= 0.0246), narrowly missing the pre-specified, one-sided significance level of 0.022 which accounted for interim analyses. Median RFS was not reached; the 6-year RFS estimate was 64% for EVE and 61% for PB. RFS improvement with EVE vs. PB was observed in the very high-risk group (HR 0.79, 95% 0.65-0.97; P1-sided= 0.011) but not in the intermediate high-risk group (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73-1.35, P1-sided= 0.48) (P for interaction = 0.22). With 290 deaths, OS was similar between arms (HR 0.90, 95% CI, 0.71 – 1.13; P1-sided= 0.178). Fewer pts completed all 54 weeks of study treatment in the EVE group (45% v 69%). In the EVE group, 37% withdrew due to AEs (vs 5% in PB). Grade 3-4 AEs occurred in 46% of pts treated with EVE and 11% with PB. The most common grade 3-4 AEs were mucositis (14% v 0%), hypertriglyceridemia (11% vs. 2%), and hyperglycemia (5% vs. 0%). Conclusions: Adjuvant EVE improved RFS in RCC pts after nephrectomy, but the nominal significance level was narrowly missed. The RFS improvement was seen despite a high rate of early treatment discontinuation. A 21% improvement in RFS with EVE was observed in pts with very high-risk disease, a group for whom adjuvant therapy may be most relevant. Clinical trial information: NCT01120249.',\n",

       "  'LBA4503Background: New drug combinations are required in advanced clear cell renal cancer (RCC). These potentially include MET inhibition with savolitinib (S) or CTLA-4 inhibition with tremelimumab (T). In this study these agents were given alone or in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (D). Methods: A multinational open-label randomised phase II study assigning patients to one of D, S, DT or DS was performed. Patients with RCC, who had previously received VEGF targeted therapy but not immune checkpoint inhibitors or MET inhibitors were included. Confirmed response rate (cRR) was the primary endpoint. A response rate of at least 50% was required for further exploration. The S arm was closed early due to a lack of efficacy. DNA alterations were measured using Foundation One and PD-L1 analysis was performed with SP263. This abstract details the pre-planned 12-month interim analyses after the cohort completed randomisation. Results: Between 2017 and 2021, 139 patients were randomised (D N=39, S N=22, DT N=39, DS N=39). The median age was 62 years (range: 28 – 85). cRRs for the 4 arms were D=10%, S=5%, DT=28%, DS=13%, which did not meet the primary objective. cRRs in the MET-driven patients (N=17) were D=0% (0/7), S=0% (0/2), DT=50% (1/2), DS=17% (1/6). cRRs in PD-L1+ves for DT and D were 14% (1/7) and 33% (2/6) respectively. 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates were D=26% (80% confidence interval [CI]: 17% - 36%), S=21% (80% CI: 10% - 35%), DT=33% (80% CI: 24% - 43%), DS=17% (80% CI: 10% - 26%). Median overall survival for D=26.1 (80% CI: 16.2 – 32.0) months, S=23.1 (80% CI: 20.6 – 29.7) months, DT=21.9 (80% CI: 16.3 – 31.5) months, DS=16.1 (80% CI: 10.3 – 18.8) months. There was 1 treatment related death in the DT arm. Of the 136 patients who received treatment, grade 3 or more treatment related adverse events occurred in D=10% (4/39), S=26% (5/19), DT=23% (9/39), DS=23% (9/39). Conclusions: This randomised phase II study did not demonstrate significant efficacy for S alone or in combination with D in RCC. The addition of T to D did not demonstrate clearly superior efficacy to D in this setting. Clinical trial information: NCT02819596.',\n",

       "  'LBA4505Background: Platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) is an active first line therapy in mUC, but duration of response is usually short. We hypothesised that switch maintenance therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib, in patients who have derived clinical benefit from PBC, would improve outcomes for mUC. Methods: ATLANTIS is an adaptive, multi-comparison, phase II trial platform. It tests multiple maintenance therapies for mUC patients who complete 4 to 8 cycles of PBC without disease progression. Whilst some patients were selected for randomisation into alternative comparisons in the platform based on putative predictive biomarkers, those who were not selected were randomised 1:1 to commence either cabozantinib 40mg once-daily or matching placebo within 10 weeks of completing PBC until progression. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) and 114 events in 140 patients (90% power, 20% 1-sided level alpha) were required to target a hazard ratio of 0.67. Due to a change in standard of care (maintenance avelumab), this was modified to 50 events in 57 patients (72.3% power, 20% 1-sided alpha) prior to the study closing early. PFS was compared between trial arms, by intention to treat, within a Cox model incorporating baseline minimisation factors. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), response rate, maximum percentage decrease in measurable disease, safety and tolerability. Results: 30 patients were randomised to cabozantinib and 31 to placebo from 25 sites (Feb 2017-March 2021). Patient characteristics (median age 69.0 years; 75.4% male; 75.4% bladder primary; 67.2% ECOG PS 0; 70.5% prior cisplatin; 36.1% visceral metastases) were balanced by treatment arm. 25 (83.3%) and 26 (83.9%) PFS events had occurred in the cabozantinib and placebo arms. Median PFS was 13.7 weeks (80% confidence interval (CI) 12.1-23.3) with cabozantinib and 15.8 weeks (80% CI 11.3-23.6) with placebo (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89 favouring cabozantinib, 80% CI 0.61-1.3, 1-sided p = 0.35). There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio 0.80 (0.52-1.23) p=0.25). In the safety population (n = 61) treatment related adverse events were mostly low grade. The most frequent (all grades), fatigue (56.7% vs 32.2%, p = 0.02), hypertension (43.3% vs 12.9%, p = 0.01), nausea (30% vs 19.4%, p = 0.36) and diarrhea (40.0% vs 6.5%, p < 0.01), were more common with cabozantinib. Overall, cabozantinib was tolerable with median duration of treatment of 13 28-day cycles of cabozantinib or 10 of placebo. 13 (43.%) vs 3 (9.7%) patients required dose reduction in the cabozantinib and placebo arms respectively. Conclusions: Though tolerable, cabozantinib did not show a significant benefit compared to placebo when used in the switch maintenance setting following platinum based chemotherapy.

       "  'LBA5004Background: The first planned interim analysis of ENZAMET, with 243 deaths after a median follow-up of 34 months, revealed a clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in mHSPC with the addition of enzalutamide to standard of care (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86, p=0.002, Davis et\\xa0al, NEJM 2019). We now present updated overall survival (OS) findings from the prespecified analysis triggered to occur after 470 deaths. Methods: We randomly assigned participants (pts) with mHSPC to treatment with testosterone suppression (TS) plus either a conventional non-steroidal anti-androgen (NSAA) or enzalutamide. Stratification factors included age, volume of disease (high vs low according to the CHAARTED definition), and planned use of concurrent docetaxel assigned by the treating physician (docetaxel yes vs no). Results: We randomized 1125 pts with a median age of 69 years, including 503 in the docetaxel stratum, and 602 with high volume metastatic disease. OS results in the table below are based on 476 deaths, a median follow-up of 68 months, and a cut-off date of 19JAN2022. The hazard rate for death was 30% lower among all those assigned enzalutamide versus control (p<0.0001). Outcomes by volume status are shown (Table) as well as the subgroups of interest with M1 high or low volume disease at diagnosis selected for concurrent docetaxel. Conclusions: Enzalutamide added to TS, compared with an active comparator of NSAA, provided clinically meaningful improvements in OS for the combined overall cohort, which persisted with an additional 3 years of follow-up. The benefits were more pronounced in pts with low volume disease, and were also seen in the subgroup with M1 high volume mHSPC despite the relatively high survival with TS+docetaxel+NSAA.

       "  'LBA5500Background: While PARP inhibitors have shown efficacy as first-line (1L) maintenance treatment for patients (pts) with ovarian cancer (OC), questions remain about the pt population that may benefit from their use. ATHENA (NCT03522246) was designed to test if rucaparib may be effective as 1L maintenance treatment in a broad pt population, including those without BRCA mutations or other evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), or high-risk clinical characteristics such as residual disease. Here we report results from the ATHENA–MONO comparison of rucaparib vs placebo. Methods: Pts with stage III–IV high-grade OC who had completed cytoreductive surgery (R0 permitted) and 4–8 cycles of 1L platinum-doublet (bevacizumab allowed with chemotherapy) with a response were randomized 4:1 to oral rucaparib 600 mg BID or placebo. Pts were stratified by HRD status (as determined by FoundationOne CDx), residual disease status after chemotherapy, and timing of surgery. The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS per RECIST was assessed in a step-down procedure first in the HRD population (BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type/loss of heterozygosity [LOH] high carcinoma) and then in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Blinded independent central review (BICR)–assessed PFS was a stand-alone, secondary endpoint. PFS in BRCA mutant and HRD-negative pts (BRCA wild-type/LOH low) were exploratory endpoints. Results: As of Mar 23, 2022 (visit cutoff), 427 and 111 pts were randomized to rucaparib monotherapy or placebo (median time on treatment, 14.7 and 9.9 mo). PFS data are shown in the Table. Most common grade ≥3 TEAEs were anemia (rucaparib, 28.7% vs placebo, 0%), neutropenia (14.6% vs 0.9%), and ALT/AST increased (10.6% vs 0.9%). Rucaparib dose reduction, interruption, and discontinuation due to TEAEs occurred in 49.4%, 60.7%, and 11.8% of pts. Conclusions: Rucaparib monotherapy is effective as 1L maintenance with significant benefit vs placebo observed in the ITT and HRD populations, as well as the non-nested subgroup of pts without known HRD.

       "  'LBA5503Background: Cortisol contributes to chemotherapy resistance by suppressing apoptotic pathways that cytotoxic agents utilize. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulation with relacorilant (RELA) reverses the anti-apoptotic effects of cortisol and restores the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. We report overall survival (OS) results from a randomized, controlled phase 2 study of RELA + nab-paclitaxel (NP) compared to NP only in patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03776812). The primary analysis showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) and a favorable safety profile with intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only, despite overrepresentation of primary platinum-refractory patients in the intermittent RELA + NP (n = 7) vs the NP-only arm (n = 1). Methods: A phase 2, open-label, randomized, 3-arm study of 2 RELA dosing schedules + NP compared with NP only was performed. 178 women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with ≤4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to: a) NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) (n = 60); b) NP (80 mg/m2) + continuous RELA (100 mg QD) (n = 58); or c) NP only (100 mg/m2) (n = 60). NP was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS; OS was a secondary endpoint. OS data for the intermittent and continuous arms were compared to NP only using a 2-sided log-rank test, stratified by presence of ascites and relapse within 6 months on previous taxane, at a 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment. Results: At the pre-defined OS analysis (128 OS events), hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.67 (95% CI [0.43, 1.03], P= 0.066) and 0.85 (95% CI [0.56, 1.29], P= 0.447) for intermittent and continuous RELA + NP vs NP only. Median OS was 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]), 11.3 (95% CI [7.5, 16.4]), and 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months in the intermittent RELA + NP, continuous RELA + NP, and NP-only arms. In the subgroup of patients without primary platinum-refractory disease, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed with HR 0.63 (95% CI [0.39, 0.99], P= 0.045) and median OS of 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]) vs 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months for intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only. Conclusions: In addition to the improved PFS and DOR observed at the primary analysis, the OS analysis confirmed the survival benefit of intermittent RELA + NP compared to NP only, particularly in patients who were not primary platinum refractory. A phase 3 trial evaluating intermittent RELA + NP vs investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in patients without primary platinum-refractory disease is ongoing (NCT05257408).

       "  'LBA5504Background: Trabectedin demonstrated antitumor activity when administered as single agent in relapsed platinum sensitive ovarian cancer (OC), with an overall response rate (ORR) ranging from 26 to 43% and a median PFS of 5 months. In addition, trabectedin showed 39.4% RR, 4.5 months median progression free survival (PFS) and 18 months median overall survival (OS) in a single arm phase 2 trial in recurrent BRCA mutated and/or the BRCAness phenotype OC patients. Methods: In this open-label, phase III, randomized trial, we assigned recurrent OC patients harboring BRCA 1/2 mutations or with BRCAness phenotype (defined as patients who had received and responded to at least 2 previous platinum-based treatments) to receive trabectedin 1.3 mg/mq q 21d or physician’s choice chemotherapy (among carboplatin, gemcitabine, weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicine or topotecan). The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoints were PFS, ORR and Duration of Response (DoR). The sample size was calculated based on the assumption that trabectedin would increase median OS from 10 to 15 months (two-sided log-rank test at the error alfa= 0.05 and a power of 80%). Medians and lifetables were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of treatment. Results: Two hundred and forty-four patients were randomized and analyzed based on the intent-to-treat principle. At a median follow up of 40 months, the median PFS was 4.4 and 4.9 months (HR= 1.03 p=0.848) and median OS was 17.9 and 15.8 months (HR=1.15 p=0.304), in the control and experimental arm, respectively. ORR was 20.2% in the group of patients receiving standard chemotherapies and 15.4% in the group of patients treated with trabectedin. No superior effect was reported for Trabectedin in the pre-specified sub-group analysis according to BRCA mutational status, type of chemotherapy and platinum-free interval. No new signal of toxicity were reported for all the chemotherapies employed. Conclusions: Trabectedin as single agent does not improve survival outcomes when compared to standard chemotherapy in BRCA mut and BRCAness phenotype OC patients.

       "  'LBA6003Background: Systemic therapy options have not been systematically evaluated in cisplatin-ineligible locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC) patients undergoing chemoradiation. This study evaluated docetaxel as a radiosensitizer in this setting. Methods: This was a randomised open-label study. Adults with LAHNSCC planned for radical or adjuvant chemoradiation, with ECOG PS 0-2 and who were cisplatin-ineligible as per the criteria by Ahn et\\xa0al were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive radiation alone or radiation with concurrent docetaxel 15 mg/m2 weekly for a maximum of 7 cycles. Adverse events were recorded in accordance with CTCAE version 4.03. The FACT-G, and H and N questionnaires (version 4) were self-administered at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and at 24 months. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) and key secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), adverse events and quality of life (Trial outcome index (TOI)). Results: The study recruited 356 patients with 176 in RT and 180 in the docetaxel-RT arm. The 2-year DFS was 30.3% (95%CI 23.6-37.4) versus 42% (95%CI 34.6-49.2) in the RT and docetaxel-RT arms respectively (Hazard ratio- 0.673; 95% CI 0.521-0.868; P-value=0.002). The median overall survival (OS) was 15.3 months (95%CI 13.1-22) in the RT arm and 25.5 months (95% CI 17.6-32.5) in the docetaxel-RT arm. (Log-rank P-value =.0.035). The 2 -year OS was 41.7% (95%CI 34.1-49.1) versus 50.8% (95%CI 43.1-58.1) in the RT and docetaxel-RT arms respectively (Hazard ratio-0.747; 95% CI 0.569-0.98; P-value=0.035). Any grade 3 or above adverse events were seen in 102 patients (58%) in RT and in 146 (81.6%) in docetaxel-RT arms respectively (P-value=0.000). There was a higher incidence of grade 3 and above mucositis (22.2% versus 49.7%; P<0.001), odynophagia (33.5% versus 52.5%; P<0.001) and dysphagia (33% versus 49.7%; P<0.002) with the addition of docetaxel. The addition of docetaxel did not lead to a worsening of TOI scores and FACT-G scores at 6 months. Conclusions: The addition of docetaxel to radiation improved disease-free survival and overall survival in cisplatin-ineligible LAHNSCC and represents a new standard of care.

       "  'LBA6016Background: The regimens approved for the treatment of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are accessible to only 1-3% of patients in low and middle-income countries due to cost. In our previous study, metronomic chemotherapy (MC) improved survival in this setting. Retrospective data suggest that a low dose of nivolumab may be efficacious. Hence, we aimed to assess whether the addition of low dose nivolumab to MC improved the overall survival. Methods: This was a randomised phase 3 superiority open-label study. Adult patients with relapsed -recurrent or newly diagnosed advanced HNSCC being treated with palliative intent with ECOG PS 0-1 were eligible. Patients were randomised 1:1 to MC consisting of methotrexate 15 mg/m2 PO weekly, celecoxib 200 mg PO daily and erlotinib 150 mg PO daily, or MC with intravenous nivolumab 20 mg flat dose once-every-3-weeks. Therapy was continued until disease progression or intolerable adverse events. Response assessment (RECIST version 1.1) was performed every 2 months. The primary endpoint was 1-year overall survival (OS) and this was a pre-specified interim analysis with the nominal p-value for efficacy being 0.006. Results: 151 patients were randomised, 75 in MC and 76 in the MC-I arm respectively. The addition of low dose nivolumab led to an improvement in the 1-year overall survival from 16.3% (95%CI 7.95-27.4) to 43.4% (95% CI 30.8-52.3) [Hazard ratio-0.545; 95%CI 0.362-0.82; P=0.00358]. The median overall survival in MC and MC-I arms was 6.7 months (95%CI 5.83 -8.07) and 10.1 months (95%CI 7.37-12.63) respectively (P=0.0052). The median progression-free survival in MC and MC-I arms was 4.57 months (95%CI 4.2 -5.3) and 6.57 months (95%CI 4.43-8.9) respectively (P=0.0021). Response rate in MC and MC-I arm were 49.3% (95% CI 37.8-60.8) and 65.2% (95%CI 53.4-75.4) respectively (P=0.085). The rate of grade 3 and above adverse events was 50% and 46.1% in MC and MC-I arm respectively (P=0.744). Conclusions: In this first-ever randomised study, the addition of low dose nivolumab led to improved overall survival and is an alternative standard of care for those who cannot access full dose nivolumab.

       "  'LBA7502Background: Elderly patients (pts) with MCL are unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy or transplantation due to excessive toxicities. Single-agent ibrutinib (Ibr), a first-in-class, oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), has transformed the care of pts with relapsed or refractory MCL with durable activity. We conducted a phase III trial (SHINE; NCT01776840) to evaluate combining Ibr with a standard chemoimmunotherapy (BR) and R maintenance in older pts with untreated MCL. Methods: Pts aged ≥ 65 years, enrolled between May 2013 and November 2014 from 183 sites across all geographical regions, were stratified by simplified MIPI score (low vs intermediate vs high risk) and were randomized 1:1 to Ibr (560 mg orally daily) or placebo (Pbo), plus 6 cycles of B (90 mg/m2) and R (375 mg/m2). Pts who achieved an objective response received R maintenance, administered every 8 weeks for up to 12 additional doses in both arms. Ibr and Pbo were administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by the investigators. Results: A total of 523 pts were randomized to Ibr + BR (n = 261) or Pbo + BR (n = 262). Median age was 71 years (range, 65–87), 65.6% of pts had low/intermediate simplified MIPI, and 8.6% had blastoid/pleiomorphic histology. At the primary analysis, median follow up was 84.7 months. The primary endpoint was met as PFS was significantly improved in the Ibr arm vs the Pbo arm (hazard ratio, 0.75; one-sided P = 0.011). Median PFS was 80.6 months with Ibr in combination with BR and R maintenance, a 50% improvement over Pbo in combination with BR and R maintenance (median PFS of 52.9 months). The complete response rate was 65.5% in the Ibr arm and 57.6% in the Pbo arm (P = 0.0567). There was no difference in overall survival between treatment arms (P = 0.648). Time to next treatment was longer in the Ibr arm compared with the Pbo arm (P < 0.001). Fifty-two (19.9%) and 106 (40.5%) pts received subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy in the Ibr and Pbo arms, respectively; 41/106 (38.7%) received a second-line BTKi in the Pbo arm. Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 81.5% and 77.3% in the Ibr and Pbo arms, respectively. Of adverse events of clinical interest for BTKis, atrial fibrillation was reported in 13.9% and 6.5% of pts in the Ibr and Pbo arms, respectively. Rates of major hemorrhage, hypertension, arthralgia, and secondary primary malignancies were similar in both arms. Quality of life was also similar in both arms. Conclusions: This phase III study in untreated MCL demonstrated that Ibr combined with BR and R maintenance significantly improved PFS compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy, with a median PFS of 6.7 years. The safety profile was consistent with the known profiles of the individual drugs. Clinical trial information: NCT01776840.',\n",

DIAL (Dual Immunomodulation in Aggressive Lymphoma) was a multi-center randomized phase II study testing the efficacy of nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) plus varlilumab (CD27 agonist) in this population. Methods: Patients were randomized (1:1) to nivolumab (240 mg IV every 2 weeks for 4 months, 480 mg IV monthly thereafter; group 1) alone or combined with varlilumab (3 mg/kg IV monthly; group 2). Cross-over (group 1 to 2) was allowed for progression. Primary endpoint was overall response (ORR) per LYRIC criteria. A sample size of 48 patients per arm would provide 80% power to detect increase in ORR from 25% to 45% using a one-sided test (p = 0.15). Pre-specified interim analysis occurred after half of the patients completed first radiologic assessment. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs). Exploratory endpoints included tumor genomic assessment and immune profiling of blood and tumor. Results: 53 patients were enrolled (27 in group 1; 26 in group 2). Interim analysis included 24 patients from each arm. Mean age was 65.2 years, 34 (70.8%) were male, and 36 (75%) received prior CAR-T cell therapy. Baseline characteristics were balanced between arms. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed in 8 (33.3%) and 7 (30.4%) of patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Common AEs (> 5%) of any grade included fatigue, lymphopenia, diarrhea, rash. There were no treatment-associated deaths. Toxicity profile was similar between arms. Table summarizes efficacy outcomes. ORR was achieved in 6 patients (12.5%), not statistically different between arms; 4 responses were complete. Seven patients crossed over (1 responded after crossing). Median OS (8.6 vs 7.3 months; p = 0.39) and PFS (2.7 vs 1.4 months; p = 0.06) were similar between arms. Subgroup analysis of patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy showed similar ORR (5/36; 14%), not statistically different between arms. Correlative analysis results will be presented at conference. The trial met futility criterion on interim analysis and enrollment ceased based on pre-specified stopping rule. Conclusions: Dual immunomodulatory therapy did not enhance anti-tumor activity in patients with aggressive B-NHL compared to nivolumab alone. Response rates were low and consistent with previous data using PD-1 inhibitors in this population. Prior therapy with CAR-T cell does not seem to sensitize patients to PD-1 blockade. Toxicity profile was acceptable and dual therapy did not increase the rate of AEs.

       "  'LBA8507Background: Atezo, in combination with CE, was the first cancer immunotherapy approved for 1L treatment of ES-SCLC. However, most pts eventually experience disease progression. TIGIT is a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint present on activated T cells and NK cells. Tira (anti-TIGIT) may synergise with other immunotherapies, such as PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors, and further amplify the immune response to improve clinical outcomes. SKYSCRAPER-02 (NCT04256421) evaluates whether the antitumor effect and survival benefits of the combination of atezo + CE could be enhanced by adding tira in pts with ES-SCLC. Methods: Eligible pts with untreated ES-SCLC (asymptomatic treated or untreated brain metastases [BM] permitted) were randomized 1:1 to receive induction tira 600 mg IV or placebo (pbo) combined with atezo 1200 mg IV + CE for 4 x 21-day cycles followed by maintenance tira or placebo combined with atezo every 3 weeks until disease progression or loss of clinical benefit. Stratification factors include ECOG PS (0 vs 1); presence/history of BM (yes vs no); LDH (≤upper limit of normal [ULN] vs >ULN). Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS and OS in all randomized pts without the history/presence of BM at baseline (primary analysis set [PAS]). Additional endpoints include PFS and OS in all randomized pts regardless of BM status (full analysis set [FAS]), objective response rate, duration of response, and safety. Results: A total of 490 patients were randomized (tira + atezo + CE, n=243; pbo + atezo + CE, n=247). As of 6 Feb 2022, median duration of follow-up was 13.9 months (mo); data represent final analysis for PFS and interim analysis for OS. In the PAS, no additional benefit was seen for tira + atezo + CE in PFS or OS compared with pbo + atezo + CE (Table). PFS and OS in the FAS were consistent with those observed in the PAS (Table). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 52.3% (tira + atezo + CE) and 55.7% (pbo + atezo + CE) and Grade 5 TRAEs occurred in 0.4% (tira + atezo + CE) and 2.0% (pbo + atezo + CE). TRAEs leading to any treatment discontinuation occurred in 5.0% and 5.3% with tira + atezo + CE and pbo + atezo + CE, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of tira to atezo + CE did not provide benefit over atezo + CE in pts with untreated ES-SCLC with or without BM. The combination was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were identified. The study will continue to planned final OS analysis.

       "  'LBA8511Background: Several studies have shown an association of pathological response, a common efficacy endpoint in neoadjuvant therapy trials, with survival for chemo in various cancers including resectable NSCLC. However, the association between pathological complete response (pCR) and survival as well as the degree of pathological regression that may be predictive of EFS for neoadjuvant immunotherapy has not been rigorously studied. CheckMate 816 (NCT02998528), a randomized phase 3 study of neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo vs chemo in resectable NSCLC, met both of its primary endpoints with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS and pCR. Here, we report a post hoc analysis from CheckMate 816, characterizing the association between pathological regression and EFS. Methods: Adults with resectable NSCLC were randomized to NIVO 360 mg + platinum-doublet chemo Q3W or chemo alone Q3W for 3 cycles. Primary endpoints were EFS and pCR (0% residual viable tumor [RVT] in the primary tumor [PT] and lymph nodes [LN] based on immune-related pathological response criteria), both assessed by blinded independent review. Major pathological response (MPR; ≤10% RVT in the PT and LN) was a secondary endpoint. In this post hoc analysis, EFS was assessed based on depth of pathological regression (measured by %RVT) in the PT only. Also, a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed the predictive ability of %RVT (PT only) for EFS outcome at 2 years, using area under the curve (AUC) to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy (0.5 = random chance; 1 = perfect accuracy). Results: Baseline characteristics in patients (pts) with pathologically evaluable samples were well balanced between the NIVO + chemo and chemo arms, similar to the overall population. In both treatment arms, EFS (minimum follow-up, 21 months) was improved in pts with vs without pCR or MPR (Table). %RVT appeared to be predictive of EFS at 2 years for NIVO + chemo (AUC = 0.74) but an association was not clear for chemo (AUC = 0.54). 2-year EFS rates for NIVO + chemo were 90%, 60%, 57%, and 39% for pts with 0–5%, >5–30%, >30–80%, and >80% RVT, respectively. Conclusions: In CheckMate 816, pathological response (pCR and MPR) in the PT was associated with improved EFS with neoadjuvant NIVO + chemo. Additionally, depth of pathological regression appeared to be predictive of improved EFS.

       "  'LBA9009Background: CNS metastases (mets) occur in 27–42% of NSCLC harboring KRASG12C mutations and are associated with poor prognosis. Adagrasib (ada), an investigational agent, is a KRASG12C inhibitor that irreversibly and selectively binds KRASG12C, locking it in its inactive state, and is optimized for favorable PK properties, including a long half-life (̃24 h) and dose-dependent PK. Ada has demonstrated dose-dependent CNS penetration and intracranial (IC) tumor regression in preclinical models of CNS mets. Methods: KRYSTAL-1 (NCT03785249) is a multicohort Phase 1/2 study evaluating ada as monotherapy or in combination with selected agents in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors harboring a KRASG12C mutation. In a Phase 1b cohort, pts with KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC and active, untreated CNS mets were treated with ada 600 mg BID. The objectives for this Phase 1b cohort were to evaluate safety and clinical activity, including systemic and IC objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Systemic responses were assessed by RECIST 1.1; IC responses were assessed by modified RANO criteria and IC RECIST. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected when feasible and was used to measure ada concentrations for optional evaluation. Results: As of 31 December 2021, 25 pts with NSCLC were enrolled and treated. Median follow-up was 6.6 months at the cutoff date. Median age was 66 years, 52% were female, 28%/72% had ECOG PS 0/1, and median lines of prior systemic therapy was one (range 0–4+). IC ORR per modified RANO criteria by BICR was 31.6% (6/19; 3 CRs, 2 PRs, 1 unconfirmed PR); IC disease control rate (DCR) was 84.2% (16/19, including 10 SDs). Median IC DOR was not reached (95% CI 4.1–NE); median IC PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI 3.8–NE). CSF samples were obtained for two pts for whom regression of CNS mets was observed and ada CSF concentrations exceeded the CNS penetrance partition coefficients observed for other therapies with demonstrated CNS penetration and CNS antitumor activity (Kp,uu 0.47). Systemic ORR by BICR was 35.0% (7/20), DCR was 80.0% (16/20) and median DOR was 9.6 months (95% CI 2.7–9.6); median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI 3.8–11.0). For all pts enrolled, OS was immature, and the median had not been reached at the time of analysis. Safety was consistent with that previously reported with ada; any grade TRAEs occurred in 96% of pts, grade 3 TRAEs in 36%, and there were no grade 4/5 TRAEs. Further data describing IC activity assessed by IC RECIST will be presented. Conclusions: Ada was well tolerated, and these preliminary data demonstrate CNS penetration and encouraging IC activity in pretreated pts with NSCLC harboring a KRASG12C mutation and active, untreated CNS mets. These are the first clinical data demonstrating CNS-specific activity of a KRASG12C inhibitor in this population. Clinical trial information: NCT03785249.',\n",

       "  'LBA9023Background: Tissue-based biomarker testing remains challenging as tumor biopsies are often inadequate for comprehensive biomarker testing and repeat biopsies can be risky in pts with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. These challenges could be overcome by using blood-based testing to identify the most appropriate targeted therapy. BFAST (NCT03178552) is a global open-label, multicohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of selected therapies in pts with advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring actionable genetic alterations, as identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in cell-free DNA (liquid biopsies). We present data from the ROS1+ cohort: this is the first evaluation of entrectinib efficacy in pts identified by prospective blood-based NGS. Methods: In this single-arm analysis, adults (≥18 years) with treatment-naïve measurable stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, identified as ROS1+ by the FoundationOne®Liquid CDx CTA blood-based NGS test, received oral entrectinib 600 mg/day until disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or death. Pts with asymptomatic brain metastases at screening were eligible. Tumor scans were performed at baseline and every 8 weeks thereafter for all disease involvement areas (brain imaging not mandated in pts without baseline CNS disease). Primary endpoint: investigator (INV)-assessed objective response rate (ORR; RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints: INV-assessed duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS); independent review facility (IRF)-assessed ORR, DoR, PFS; overall survival (OS); time to CNS PD; safety. Results: 55 pts with ROS1+ NSCLC identified by blood-based NGS were enrolled and treated with entrectinib. Median age was 56 yrs; 58% of pts were female and 75% had no history of tobacco use. Non-squamous adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (n = 48/55; 87%); 4 pts (7.3%) had baseline CNS disease. Median follow-up: 18.3 months. At data cut-off (26 Nov 2021, n = 54 pts with measurable disease), confirmed ORR was 81.5% (n = 44/54; 95% CI 68.6–90.8) by INV (2 complete responses [CR], 42 partial responses [PR]) and IRF (3 CR, 41 PR). Median DoR was 13.0 months (95% CI 6.3–18.4) by INV and 16.7 months (95% CI 5.6–24.0) by IRF. Median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI 8.7–18.5) by INV, and 14.8 months (95% CI 7.2–24.0) by IRF. OS data were immature with 20 events (36.4%) recorded. Median time to CNS PD was not reached (INV: 9 events; IRF: 6 events). Most treatment-related adverse events were non-serious with no treatment-related deaths. Conclusion: These data support the clinical value of blood-based NGS as another method to inform clinical decision-making in ROS1+ NSCLC. Pts with ROS1+ NSCLC (by blood-based NGS) treated with entrectinib showed deep and durable responses, consistent with results from entrectinib trials that used tissue-based testing. No new safety signals were observed. Clinical trial information: NCT03178552.',\n",

Here we present the longest reported follow-up (5 y) of a phase 3 trial of 1L combination immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC. Methods: Adults with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent NSCLC, no known EGFR/ALK alterations, and an ECOG performance status ≤ 1 were enrolled and stratified by histology. Pts with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO (3 mg/kg Q2W) + IPI (1 mg/kg Q6W), NIVO (240 mg Q2W), or chemo. Pts with tumor PD-L1 < 1% were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO + IPI, NIVO (360 mg Q3W) + chemo, or chemo. Pts were treated until progression, toxicity, or ≤ 2 y for immunotherapy. Assessments included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and a novel efficacy endpoint, treatment-free interval. Treatment-free interval was measured in pts who discontinued study therapy (for any reason including treatment completion) and was defined as the time from last study dose to start of subsequent systemic therapy or death, whichever occurred first. Results: Minimum follow-up was 61.3 mo (database lock, Feb 15, 2022). In pts with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% (N = 1189), continued long-term OS benefit was seen with NIVO + IPI vs chemo (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.66–0.91]); 5-y OS rates were 24% (NIVO + IPI), 17% (NIVO), and 14% (chemo). OS benefit also continued in pts with tumor PD-L1 < 1% (N = 550) for NIVO + IPI vs chemo (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52–0.81]); 5-y OS rates were 19% (NIVO + IPI), 10% (NIVO + chemo), and 7% (chemo). Clinical benefit with NIVO + IPI vs chemo was observed across additional efficacy endpoints in the overall population and in pts alive at 5 y (table). PFS, ORR, and DOR with NIVO and NIVO + chemo will be presented. Among pts alive at 5 y in the NIVO + IPI group, 66% (PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and 64% (PD-L1 < 1%) remained treatment-free ≥ 3 y after discontinuing study therapy; median (range) duration of NIVO ± IPI therapy was 17.7 (0-25.5) mo (PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and 9.5 (0-25.1) mo (PD-L1 < 1%). No new safety signals were observed. Conclusions: With a 5-y minimum follow-up, NIVO + IPI continues to provide long-term, durable clinical benefit vs chemo in previously untreated pts with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. NIVO + IPI led to increased 5-y survivorship; the majority of these pts were treatment-free for ≥ 3 y post-treatment discontinuation.

Here, we report updated efficacy and safety with a 3-year minimum follow-up, as well as exploratory biomarker analyses from this study. Methods: Adults with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC, no known sensitizing EGFR/ALK alterations, and ECOG performance status ≤ 1 were randomized 1:1 to NIVO 360 mg Q3W + IPI 1 mg/kg Q6W + 2 cycles of chemo (n = 361) or 4 cycles of chemo alone (n = 358). Pts were stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression, sex, and histology. Pts with non-squamous (NSQ) NSCLC in the chemo-alone arm could receive pemetrexed maintenance. Assessments included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR). For all pts with NSQ NSCLC and with tissue evaluable for mutational analysis (n = 313), the FoundationOne CDxTM assay was used to identify mutant (mut) or wild type (wt) KRAS and STK11 genes. Exploratory assessments included evaluation of OS and PFS with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo by mutation status and safety. Results: At a minimum follow-up of 36.1 mo (database lock: Feb 15, 2022), pts continued to derive long-term, durable OS benefit with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.62–0.87]); 3-y OS rates were 27% vs 19%. Clinical benefit with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo was observed in all randomized pts and across most subgroups, including by PD-L1 expression level (Table) or histology. In an exploratory analysis in pts evaluable for mutations including KRAS and STK11, OS appeared to be improved with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo (median OS, 16.3 vs 13.1 mo). Similar trends of prolonged OS with NIVO + IPI + chemo vs chemo were also seen in pts with or without KRAS mutation (median OS, mut: 19.2 vs 13.5 mo; wt: 15.6 vs 12.7 mo) or STK11 mutation (mut: 13.8 vs 10.7 mo; wt: 17.8 vs 13.9 mo), respectively.

We present new data from the analysis of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) with longer follow up. Methods: A total of 976 pts aged ≥12 years with complete resection of cutaneous stage IIB or IIC melanoma and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg (2 mg/kg for pediatric pts) or placebo Q3W for 17 cycles (approximately 1 year) in Part 1 of the study. Randomization was stratified by T category 3b, 4a, 4b (adults) with a separate stratum for pediatric pts. Treatment continued until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Pts who received placebo in Part 1, or who did not experience disease progression within 6 months of completing Part 1 were eligible for additional cycles of pembro Q3W at recurrence (Part 2). The primary endpoint was RFS per investigator. DMFS by investigator is a secondary endpoint. The data cut-off date for this interim analysis was Jan 4th, 2022. Results: At median follow-up of 26.9 mo (range, 4.6-39.2), adjuvant pembro significantly improved DMFS (HR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.47-0.88; P=0.0029; median not reached [NR] for both) vs placebo. The 24-mo DMFS rate was 88.1% vs 82.2%. There was consistent reduction in the risk of recurrence with pembro vs placebo (HR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.50-0.84) with further follow-up. The 24-mo RFS rate was 81.2% vs 72.8%. Grade ≥ 3 any-cause AEs occurred in 137 (28.4%) vs 97 (20.0%) pts in the pembro vs placebo arms. Grade ≥ 3 drug-related AEs occurred in 83 (17.2%) vs 24 (4.9%) pts. One pt in the pembro arm and 5 pts in the placebo arm died due to an any-cause AE. No deaths were drug-related. Immune-mediated AEs occurred in 182 (37.7%) vs 45 (9.3%) pts, most commonly hypothyroidism (17.2% vs 3.7%). Conclusions: Adjuvant pembrolizumab vs placebo for resected stage IIB and IIC melanoma significantly improved DMFS, with continued reduction in the risk of recurrence, and a favorable benefit-risk profile.

       "  'LBA9509Background: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in approximately 50% of the patients, with the liver being the most common site. The median survival for patients with liver metastases is about 6-12 months, and there are only few systemic treatment options available that moderately prolong survival. A previous trial using isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) has suggested a 14-month increase in overall survival, compared with a historical control group consisting of the longest surviving patients in Sweden during the same time period (26 vs. 12 months). Methods: In this multicenter randomized, controlled, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated isolated liver metastasis from uveal melanoma were randomized between 2013 and 2021 to receive IHP or best alternative care (control group). The primary end point is overall survival at 24 months, but here we report the secondary outcomes of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS) and toxicity. Results: A total of 93 patients were randomized, with three patients in each group being excluded due to either withdrawal of consent or inappropriate enrollment, and a total of 87 patients were assigned to either IHP group (43 patients) or control group (44 patients). In the IHP group, 41 (89%) patients were treated per protocol, and in the control group, 49% of the patients were treated with chemotherapy, 39% with immunotherapy and 9% with localized treatment interventions. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate (ORR) in the IHP group was 40% (17/43) compared to 4.5% (2/44) in the control group (p<0.0001). The median hPFS in the IHP group was 9.1 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 13.4 months), compared to 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 4.0 months) in the control group (p<0.0001). The median PFS in the IHP group was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.2 to 11.6 months), compared to 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.7 months) in the control group (p<0.0001). There were 14 treatment-related serious adverse events in the IHP group, where vascular complication and infections were the most common side effects, compared to 13 in the control group where immunotherapy related side effects were most common. There was one treatment related death in the IHP group. Conclusions: Treatment with IHP resulted in superior ORR, hPFS and PFS compared to best alternative care among previously untreated patients with isolated uveal melanoma liver metastasis.

       "  'LBA11501Background: We conducted a randomized, phase II non-comparative trial evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant ICB [nivolumab or ipilimumab/nivolumab] in patients (pts) with surgically resectable retroperitoneal DDLPS or extremity/truncal UPS treated with concurrent neoadjuvant radiation therapy (XRT, UPS only). Methods: As of February 28 2022, all pts have a minimum follow-up of 2 years from the start of ICB treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using Kaplan Meier method. The association of pathologic response (percent hyalinization and viable tumor at surgery) with PFS and OS was assessed using Cox univariate models. Comparison of survival curves was done by log-rank method. The intratumoral BCR repertoire was evaluated by bulk tumor RNA sequencing with TRUST4 algorithm, on biopsy specimens collected at baseline. Description of the intratumoral BCR repertoire included diversity by inverse Simpson index, and clonal distribution by Gini coefficient. High and low categories were defined by median values. Results: At a median follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range [IQR]=27-43) since start of ICB treatment, the median PFS was not reached (NR) in UPS (IQR=19-NR) and 18 months for DDLPS (IQR=8-NR), with 13 pts experiencing relapse (2 UPS, 11 DDLPS) and 2 pts who had progressive metastatic disease on treatment (1 UPS, 1 DDLPS). Five pts died of disease relapse (1 UPS, 4 DDLPS) and the median OS was NR. There was no association between percent hyalinization at surgery and PFS (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.98, p=0.12) or OS (HR=0.99, p=0.60) nor between percent viable tumor at surgery and PFS (HR=1.00, p=0.62) or OS (HR=1.00, p=0.67). There was no association between RECIST response and PFS (p=0.67) or OS (p=0.67). The median BCR heavy chain (IgH) clonal counts detected at baseline was 2,536 per sample (IQR=82-7,680), and the median BCR light chain (IgL) clonal count was 8,870 per sample (IQR=306-30,214). Pts with higher intratumoral BCR clonality and diversity at baseline tended to have longer PFS (Table). High BCR IgH clonality was significantly associated with OS (p=0.02) with consistent trends in each histotype (DDLPS: p=0.06; UPS: p=0.25). Conclusions: Survival results demonstrate efficacy of ICB with XRT in UPS but there is a crucial need to define better predictive markers of survival after neoadjuvant therapy. Further characterization of the BCR repertoire is ongoing and will be presented at the meeting.

       "  'LBA12003Background: Radiation dermatitis (RD) secondary to radiation therapy (RT) to treat cancer reduces quality of life (QoL) and can lead to treatment interruption. The exact etiology of RD is unknown, and bacteria play a role in other inflammatory dermatoses. As our group recently showed nasal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) prior to RT was an independent predictor of grade ≥2 RD, we conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating efficacy of bacterial decolonization (BD) to prevent RD and improve QoL. Methods: This is a randomized phase II trial comparing BD to standard of care (SC) for adult patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer to receive fractionated (≥ 15 fractions) RT. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the BD intervention of intranasal mupirocin ointment twice daily and chlorhexidine body wash once daily for 5 consecutive days before RT start and repeated for 5 days every other week during RT or the SC arm of emollient use as needed. The primary endpoint was development of grade ≥2 RD using Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03, and planned sample size was 80 patients. Evaluation of a preliminary cohort showed wide variability of disease in grade 2 RD, so grade 2 RD was further differentiated for more refined statistical analysis: “moderate to brisk erythema” defined as grade 2 and “patchy moist desquamation” defined as grade 2 with moist desquamation (2-MD). The secondary endpoint was patient-reported QoL assessed via the SKINDEX-16 (SD-16) questionnaire before and after RT. Bacterial culture swabs of the nares and skin at RT beginning, middle, and end were obtained for both groups. Results: 80 patients were randomized 1:1 to each arm (40 BD, 40 SC) June 2019-August 2021. 78 breast and 2 head and neck cancer patients were enrolled instead of the projected 40 of each cancer type. 76 patients were included for analysis (38 BD, 38 SC). Clinical and demographic characteristics were well balanced between arms. We demonstrated prevention of RD grades 2-MD or higher in the BD arm compared to the SC arm (0/38, 0% vs 9/38, 23.68%; P=0.002). Additionally, BD resulted in a significantly lower median RD grade compared to SC (1.19±0.7 vs 1.58±0.75, P=0.019). Finally, a linear regression model showed a significant association between BD and decreased RD grade (estimate=-0.431, 95% CI: -0.7516, -0.1054; p=0.010), even when adjusting for other RD risk factors. Most patients reported no difficulty with BD and only one patient discontinued due to itch. There was no difference in QoL outcomes between arms. Conclusions: Our results support the use of a BD regimen to prevent moist desquamation in patients receiving RT for breast or head and neck cancer. Our study included mainly breast cancer patients; thus BD efficacy needs to be tested in other solid tumors receiving RT. This is the first study demonstrating efficacy of BD to reduce RD. Given the safety and availability of this regimen, we suggest adding BD to RD prophylaxis protocols. Clinical trial information: NCT03883828.',\n",

       "  'LBA12065Background: COVID-19 infection has poor outcomes for patients (pts) with cancer. Understanding vaccine response as a correlate of protection from severe infection is essential to advise pts regarding protective behaviours and optimal vaccine schedule. This Australian cohort is unique due to low rates of COVID-19 exposure at study entry (July-November 2021). and use of a 3 dose schedule. Pts initially received 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (Pf) at a 3 week interval, or ChadOx1-S (AZ) at a 6 week interval, all then received a 3rd dose, either mRNA-1273 (Mod) or Pf after 2-4 months, and finally a 4th dose at an interval of a further 3 months, for a subset. Methods: SerOzNET (ACTRN12621001004853) has enrolled pts with solid and haematological (haem) cancers prior to initial vaccination. Serial blood samples were processed for serum, PBMC and PMN at timepoints: 0, then 3-4 weeks post dose 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 (where administered). We report here neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against wild type (wt) and delta and omicron variants of concern (VOC); quantitative S-protein IgG antibody (Abbott); T-cell correlates measured by levels of interferon-g (IFN g), tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukins (IL-) 2/4/5/13; and epigenetic profiling of T cells. Results: The cohort consists of 401 pts with median age 58 (range 18-85); 59% female; 128 (32%) haem cancers. 377 (94%) are on current or recent (< 12 months) systemic therapy: 162 (43%) chemotherapy, 62 (16%) immunotherapy, 40 (10%) combined chemo/immunotherapy, 113 (29%) hormonal or targeted therapy. 42 (10%) received anti-CD20 therapy < 12 months, 6 (1.4%) had allogeneic stem cell transplant. NAb levels against wt are available for 256 pts post dose 1, 245 pts post dose 2 and 159 pts post dose 3 (will be updated). Response rates post dose were respectively 27%, 77% and 88%. Pts with haem cancer were less likely to respond to vaccination at any time compared to pts with solid cancer (p < 0.001, chi-squared test). After 3 doses, 3.8% of pts with solid cancer and 27.8% with haem cancer lacked NAb. NAb results to VOC delta are available for 92 pts post dose 2: 25/92 (27%) were negative, compared with a non-response rate to wt of 15% at same time in same pts. IFN-γ-Spike response was detectable in 18/31 (58%) and 24/30 (80%) pts post dose 1 and 2 respectively. 101 pts to date have received a 4th dose; data will be available at the meeting, as will epigenetic profiles and detailed clinicopathological correlations. Conclusions: This interim analysis shows that a significant proportion of pts with haem cancers (27.8%) lack protective Sars-CoV-2 antibodies following 3 vaccinations, whereas only 3.8% of solid cancer pts lack detectable response. Results from other B and T cell parameters may also be important in identifying pts less well protected by vaccination. Follow up is ongoing, response rate post 4th dose will be presented at the meeting. Clinical trial information: ACTRN12621001004853.',\n",

       "  'LBA12068Background: There is limited published data regarding safety and toxicity of Sars-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with cancer. This may contribute to vaccine hesitancy amongst some members of this vulnerable cohort (Nguyen 2022). Methods: SerOzNET (ACTRN12621001004853) is a large prospective cohort study of adults and children with cancer undergoing Sars-CoV-2 vaccination. Participants undertake surveys by text message link sent to their mobile phone, or on an iPad provided in clinic. A validated hesitancy survey is undertaken at enrolment (Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence and Complacency Scale), and prior to the 3rd vaccine dose. For children, a parental survey is also collected. Quality of life is assessed with serial EORTC QLQ-C30 (adults) or PedsQL (children, self- and parent- report) at baseline and serially throughout the study. Patient- reported vaccine toxicity is assessed by patient-reported CTCAE items for common vaccine related AEs and patient-reported impact of vaccination on cancer treatment (delays, hospitalisations). Medically ascertained vaccine toxicity is assessed by study investigators one month after the 3rd vaccination dose. Results: Five hundred and four participants have been enrolled (403 adults (80%) and 101 children (20%)). Hesitancy: At baseline, 351 adults (88%) and 56 children (55%) responded. The adult cohort was predominantly female (67.2%) with an average age of 53.8 years. Preliminary analysis showed similar levels of vaccination concerns between baseline (mean score = 18.4, SD = 5.1) and follow-up pre-3rd dose (mean score = 17.9, SD = 5.7) in adults. We will present results regarding whether self-reported COVID-19 vaccine toxicity after the first dose was related to change in hesitancy scores at follow-up, which may have implications for COVID-19 vaccine booster willingness. Patient toxicity surveys have been returned post dose 1 for 445/497 (91%), post dose 2 for 417/457 (91%) and post dose 3 for 280/334 (84%). Incidence of any AEs was high (77-100% depending on age and dose), however the incidence of severe AEs (patient reported) was low (0-10% depending on age and dose). Interruptions to cancer treatment after vaccination were uncommon (2-12%). Pain at the injection site was the most commonly reported AE for all ages and doses. Hospital admissions (any reason) were reported post dose 1 in 4/15 children aged 5-12, but were uncommon in older adolescents and adults. The most common systemic adverse effect was rigors in children 5-12, while adolescents and adults reported fatigue most frequently. Quality of life analysis is ongoing and will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: It is feasible to collect detailed toxicity and quality of life data in a large cohort of cancer patients receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. Data to date are reassuring that severe adverse events and interruptions to cancer therapy are uncommon. Clinical trial information: ACTRN12621001004853.']]"

       "  '1Background: The ESE-ENSAT guidelines on ACC management suggest adjuvant mitotane for patients at high risk of recurrence. This indication has limited evidence base, lacking results from randomized controlled trials. No suggestion for or against adjuvant mitotane in low-risk patients was given, since studies did not stratify patients for prognosis. The randomized controlled study ADIUVO compared the efficacy of adjuvant mitotane treatment vs. observation in prolonging recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients at low-intermediate risk of recurrence. Methods: The main inclusion criteria were: stage I-III ACC, R0 surgery, and Ki-67 ≤10%. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to adjuvant mitotane or observation. The primary endpoint of the study was RFS. Patients who refused randomization were eligible for the ADIUVO OBSERVATIONAL study. In this prospective, observational study, patients were managed as in ADIUVO except for randomization. A total of 91 patients were enrolled in ADIUVO, 45 in the mitotane and 46 in the observation arm. Baseline characteristics of patients were perfectly matched between the 2 arms: median age, 51 vs. 50.5 years; female, 73% vs. 67%; stage I, 20% vs. 26%; stage II, 67% vs. 63%, stage III, 13% vs. 11%; ACC secretion 44% vs. 36%; Weiss 5 vs. 5; respectively. In ADIUVO OBSERVATIONAL, 42 patients were treated with mitotane and 53 were untreated. Baseline characteristics of patients were matched between the 2 groups and with mitotane and observation groups in ADIUVO. Thus, the ADIUVO OBSERVATIONAL cohort was analyzed in parallel to deal with the lower than expected recruitment in ADIUVO. Results: In the ADIUVO study, recurrences were 8 in the MIT and 11 in the OBS arm, while deaths were 2 and 5, respectively. RFS and overall survival (OS) did not significantly differ between the 2 arms. In the OBS arm, the HR for recurrence was 1.321 (95%CI, 0.55-3.32, p = 0.54) and HR for death 2.171 (95%CI, 0.52-12.12, p = 0.29). The survival analysis in the ADIUVO OBSERVATIONAL study confirmed that of ADIUVO. Given the outcome of both studies, the NNT is 55. Conclusions: ACC patients at low-intermediate risk of recurrence after surgery are a minority; however, they show a far better prognosis than expected (5-yr RFS is 75%) and do not benefit significantly from adjuvant mitotane. The results of the ADIUVO study do not support routine use of adjuvant mitotane in this subset of patients, who may thus avoid a potentially toxic treatment. This is an important step toward personalization of ACC care. Clinical trial information: NCT00777244.',\n",

       "  '2Background: Gender disparity in academic medicine has been a longstanding issue. Efforts have been made to recognize this imbalance and increase inclusivity. Despite this, a recent study examining the prevalence of all-male panels (“manels”) found that female faculty are significantly underrepresented at urology meetings, and nearly two-thirds of the sessions were manels. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and longitudinal trends of manels and gender representation across genitourinary oncology disciplines at the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (GU ASCO). Methods: GU ASCO online programs from 2018-2021 were used to obtain faculty information. Data collected included perceived gender, medical specialty, and panel role (chair/moderator vs. non-chair/non-moderator). For year 2021, additional data about the panelists, including the number of publications, H-index, citations, and academic rank, was collected. The primary outcomes were the percentage of manels and proportion of female panelists over time. Additionally, female representation among chair/moderators and specialties were evaluated. Results: Among 83 sessions involving 317 faculty members, 227 (71.6%) were males (p<0.001), and 28 panel sessions (33.7%) were manels. Between 2018 and 2020, there was a decrease in the prevalence of manels from 45% to 21.7%, but in 2021, it rose to 32.0%. The proportion of female panel members increased over time from 17.1% in 2018 to 35.7% in 2021 (p=0.012). The role of chair/moderator was predominantly represented by males (67.2%, p<0.001). The proportion of male panelists was particularly high in urology (91.2%, p<0.001) and radiation oncology (81.8%, p=0.002) compared to medical oncology (54.6%). In 2021, male speakers held higher academic rank (i.e. professor, associate, assistant) (p=0.020) and had a greater number of publications (p=0.003), H-index (p=0.009), citations (p=0.014) than females (Table). Conclusions: Over time, the number of female panelists increased with a corresponding decrease in proportion of manels, with the exception of 2021. Future studies that include data on meeting participant demographics will provide insight on whether panelists are over/under-represented in proportion to the audience. While improvements in male and female representation have been made over the years, meeting organizers should strive for representation that reflects a diversity of expertise and perspectives.

       "  '3Background: Patients (Pts) with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (aPeCa) have a poor prognosis (21% 2-year overall survival from moment of diagnosis) and high morbidity, due to progressive locoregional disease. Pre-clinical studies show high rates of infiltrating immune cells and high PD-L1 expression, suggesting that immunotherapy may be beneficial for these patients. In the PERICLES study, we assess the activity of atezolizumab (atezo) in aPeCa pts, with or without radiotherapy (RT) to control locoregional lymph node disease. Methods: A single-centre phase 2 study with two treatment arms (non-randomized) was conducted in 32 histologically confirmed aPeCa pts with a WHO performance status of 0-1 (NCT03686332). Any previous treatment except for immunotherapy was allowed. Study treatment consisted of atezo 1200 mg every 3 weeks (all pts). Pts expected to benefit from RT for locoregional disease control (cohort A) additionally received 33 fractions of 1.5 Gy (locoregional affected lymph node regions and penile region) and 1.8 Gy (macroscopic tumor + margin) irradiation. Response was evaluated with 12-weekly CT scans of the abdomen and thorax using RECIST1.1. Toxicity was scored by NCI-CTCAE V4. The primary endpoint was 1-year progression free survival (PFS) for the full cohort. Results: From Oct 2018 to Aug 2021, 20 pts were included in cohort A (RT + atezo) and 12 pts in cohort B (only atezo). Median follow-up was 22 months (interquartile range (IQR) 4.3-14). Median age was 67 years (IQR 60-72) and all patients had stage IV aPeCa. Pts received no prior treatment (25%), or prior RT (34%), chemoradiation (22%), chemotherapy (6%) or surgery (69%). An immunotherapy or radiotherapy-related grade 3-4 AE was observed in 3/32 (9.4%) and 1/20 (5.0%) patients, respectively. There were no grade 5 treatment-related AEs. One-year PFS was 12% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-33), which did not meet the primary objective. The response rate of RECIST1.1 evaluable pts was 30% (see table). In two patients with pulmonary metastases, a complete response was observed. Initial responses with early progression were seen in 5 pts. Median overall survival (OS) was 12 months (95% CI 5.4-19). Conclusions: Anti-tumor activity of atezo was observed in aPeCa, including complete and durable responses. The trial failed to meet its primary objective (PFS). Our results suggest that a subset of aPeCa pts has incomplete immunological activity and/or early resistance to atezo. Analysis of tumor tissue collected in this trial (including on-treatment biopsies) could suggest new therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance and improve clinical outcome to immunotherapy in aPeCa.

       "  '4Background: Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with few treatments in the advanced setting and little success of immune-checkpoint inhibitions (ICI). Around half of penile SCC cases are linked to HPV infection. We aimed to report the landscape of somatic alterations and ICI-related biomarkers in penile SCC in the Caris Life Sciences dataset and to establish signatures for HPV-dependent and HPV-independent oncogenesis. Methods: Penile SCC tumors were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of DNA (TruSeq, 45 genes; NextSeq, 592 genes and NovaSeq, whole exome sequencing (WES)) and RNA (NovaSeq). PD-L1 expression was tested by IHC using SP142. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was tested by fragment analysis, IHC and NGS. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was measured by counting all somatic mutations found per tumor (TMB-high: >10 mutations per MB). HPV16/18 status was determined using WES when available. Significance was determined using chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum test and adjusted for multiple comparisons (q-value <0.05). Results: Among the entire cohort (N=108), the median age was 66 years and 79.6% of tumors were primary and 20.4% of tumors were metastatic. In the overall cohort, the most frequently detected mutations were TP53 (46%), CKDN2A (26%), PIK3CA (25%), TERT promoter (22%), KMT2C (16%) and NOTCH1 (14%), consistent with previous reports. Overall, 51% of tumors were PD-L1+ (SP142, >1%), 10.7% had high TMB, and 1.1% had dMMR/MSI-H. Of the 108 tumors, 29 had HPV status tested by WES (HPV16/18+, n=13 and HPV16/18-, n=16). KMT2C mutations (33% vs 0%) and FGF3 amplifications (30.8% vs 0%) were specific to HPV16/18+ tumors, while CDKN2A mutations (37.5% vs 0%) were exclusive to HPV16/18- tumors. HPV16/18+ tumors also had a trend towards decreased TP53 (7.7% vs 63%) and TERT promoter (25% vs 77%) alterations (Table). TMB-high were exclusively found in the HPV16/18+ group (30.8% vs 0%), while PD-L1 and dMMR/MSI-H status were comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: To our knowledge, our comprehensive NGS study of penile SCC somatic alterations is the largest to date. HPV16/18+ vs HPV16/18- penile SCC were molecularly distinct tumors, consistent with previous reports. Our finding that TMB-high was exclusive to patients with HPV16/18+ tumors requires confirmation in larger datasets and could be used for better patient stratification in ICI clinical trials.BiomarkerHPV- penile SCC (N=16)HPV+ penile SCC (N=13)P-valueQ-valueNGS-TERT76.9%25.0%0.0321NGS-TP5362.5%7.7%0.0061NGS-CDKN2A37.5%0.0%0.0201NGS-PIK3CA6.3%30.8%0.1441NGS-FBXW76.3%23.1%0.2991NGS-KMT2C0%33.3%0.0241NGS-CREBBP0%23.1%0.0781CNA-FGF30%30.8%0.0301PD-L162.5%69.2%11dMMR/MSI-H0%7.7%0.4481TMB-High0%30.8%0.0351 ',\n",

       "  '5 Background: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy that accounts for less than 1% of male cancers in the United States. Localized disease, particularly T1 tumors (no invasion the corpora spongiosum, corpora cavernosa or adjacent structures using the AJCC 7th edition staging system) are potentially curable with local surgery. We present the racial differences in survival outcomes for T1, penile cancer from the SEER database. Methods: From 2004 to 2016, we identified all patients with T1 (coded as T1, T1a, T1b),N0,M0 penile cancer in the SEER-18 database were included. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable (adjusting for age, year of diagnosis, race, socioeconomic status, primary tumor site and type of surgery) Cox-Regression analysis were conducted to investigate prognostic variables for cancer specific survival (CCS). Results: A total of 4,406 patients were identified with penile cancer; 1,941 patients had T1 disease and were further evaluated (Table). On multivariable analysis, Black (HR: 1.72, CI 1.01- 2.94; p=0.046) and Hispanic individuals (HR: 2.15, CI 1.36- 3.40; p= 0.001) had worse CSS compared to the White men with T1 disease. Logistic regression analysis shows no difference in the application of primary surgical resection by race (p=0.065). In the univariate analysis, patients who underwent primary site surgery had better 5-year CSS (HR: 0.36, CI 0.22-0.60; p <0.001). Among those undergoing primary surgery, the 5-year CSS was superior with excisional biopsy (HR: 0.22, CI 0.12-0.40; p < 0.001) compared to simple/partial removal of the primary tumor. Conclusions: Significant racial disparities in CSS exist in early-stage penile cancer patients. CSS is worse in Black and Hispanic T1 penile cancer patients compared to White patients. CSS is also decreased in those without any primary surgery and in those treated with simple/partial surgical removal compared to excisional biopsy. Further research on the cause of racial disparity outcomes in penile cancer is needed.Multivariable analysis of predictors for CSS in men with T1 Penile Cancer.VariablesHR (95% CI)PRaceWhiteRefBlack1.72 (1.01- 2.94)0.047Hispanic2.15 (1.36- 3.40)0.001Other0.44 (0.14-1.44)0.170SurgeryNo primary site surgeryRefSimple/partial removal0.36 (0.20-0.63)< 0.001Excision Biopsy0.22 (0.12-0.40)< 0.001 ',\n",

       "  '6Background: Penile cancer undergoes a stepwise dissemination and metastasises first to the inguinal lymph nodes (ILN). Because men can be cured in this early stage of metastatic disease, early detection and treatment is important. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of men with ≥T1G2 penile cancer and negative inguinal US guided FNA undergoing DSNB. Men with suspicious US but negative FNA underwent US guided ILN excision. Men with ≥T1G2 local recurrence during follow-up and non-squamous cell histologies were excluded. Descriptive analysis was performed, and sensitivity and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated. Results: The final cohort consisted of 403 men with a median age of 65 years (IQR 55-73) and body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m² (IQR 25-33) for this analysis. This gave 728 groins with negative FNA undergoing DSNB +/- US guided lymph node excision. At least one sentinel node (SN) was visualised in 93% during the 1st and in 7% during the 2nd lymphoscintigraphy. Median SNs visualised preoperatively was 1 and a median of 2 nodes were resected. ILN metastases were detected in 9% groins with non-palpable and in 17% with palpable lymph nodes. Stratified by non-palpable and palpable ILN, non-local recurrence despite pathologically negative DSNBs was observed in 0.5% and 0%. Limited to men with at least 24 months follow-up, non-local recurrence after negative DSNBs was observed in 0.4% and 0%. The sensitivity of DSNB was 96% and NPV was 100%. The main limitation of this analysis is its retrospective nature and inherit biases. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in a high volume centre pre-operative ultrasound +/- FNA and DSNB can be used to accurately stage men with non-palpable and palpable ILN in men with ≥T1G2 penile cancer. Further, FNA in advance of surgery provides logistical and surgical advantages. In those patients with palpable disease but negative FNA, we advocate ultrasound guided excision in case of enlarged or suspicious ILN during DSNB.Median Charlson Comorbidity Index [IQR]5 [3-6]T Stage (%)T1T1aT1bT2T3Missing45 (11.2)58 (14.3)80 (19.9)177 (43.9)42 (10.4)1 (0.2)Grade (%)G2G3G4Missing166 (41.1)233 (57.8)2 (0.5)2(0.5)Margin status (%)NegativePositivePeIN positiveMissing273 (67.7)35 (8.7)53 (13.2)42 (10.4)Histology (%)Squamous cell carcinomaSarcomatoid squamous cell carcinomaBasaloid squamous cell carcinomaWarty carcinomaBasaloid warty mixSubtype missing356 (88.3)5 (1.2)33 (8.2)6 (1.5)1 (0.2)2 (0.5)Clinical Lymph Node Status Right (%) n=370Non palpablePalpableMissing306 (82.7)58 (15.7)6 (1.6)Clinical Lymph Node Status Left (%) n=358Non palpablePalpableMissing309 (86.3)43 (12)6 (1.7)DSNB protocol (%)1-day protocol2-day protocolMissing358 (49.2)366 (50.3)4 (0.5)Median Follow up months [IQR]28 [13-58] ',\n",

       "  'TPS7Background: Penis cancer is a rare but potentially fatal disease. A limited body of evidence exists on which to base the majority of management decisions for patients with regional nodal metastases. Five-year survival for patients with a single involved inguinal lymph node treated with surgery alone is approximately 80%, whilst it ranges from 0 to 12% for patients with pelvic node involvement (N3). Additional strategies are required for the management regionally-advanced disease. InPACT (NCT02305654) aims to determine prospectively the relative benefits and sequencing of surgery, chemotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy in the management of patients with penis cancer who present with palpable or radiologically evident inguinal lymph node metastases. InPACT addresses the following questions: Is there a role for neoadjuvant therapy and, if so, which of the two options (chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) before surgery gives superior outcomes? Among patients whose inguinal node histology predicts a high risk of recurrence, does prophylactic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) plus chemoradiation to the inguinal and pelvic fields improve survival compared to chemoradiation alone? Methods: A Bayesian trial design aims to include a wide population of patients and incorporates two randomisations: InPACT-neoadjuvant and InPACT-pelvis. Participants are stratified by disease burden (extent of nodal involvement), by the presence or absence of high-risk radiological features, and by GFR. Participants with high disease burden where neoadjuvant treatment is thought to be indicated are randomised to neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Participants with intermediate disease burden are randomised to one of 3 arms: Surgery alone or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. Participants in the low-burden group proceed directly to surgery. Participants with postoperative inguinal node pathology that shows high-risk features may then proceed to InPACT-pelvis where randomisation is between adjuvant chemoradiotherapy ± PLND for those not previously treated with chemoradiotherapy & between PLND & observation for those previously treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The study aims to recruit 200 participants. The primary outcome measure is overall survival, with secondary outcome measures of disease-specific survival, disease-free survival, and freedom from locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis. Feasibility, toxicity, the type/extent of surgical complications, and quality of life will be assessed as secondary endpoints for all the InPACT treatment arms. To October 2021, 65 participants have been recruited with centres open in the UK, US and Canada. Clinical trial information: NCT02305654.',\n",

       "  'TPS8Background: PSqCC is a rare tumor with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The current standard of care for advanced disease has been palliative platinum-based chemotherapy, with only marginal survival benefit. Recent data has shown that the majority of PSqCC patients present high levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The ORPHEUS trial is evaluating the efficacy and safety of INCMGA00012 –a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antagonist– in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PSqCC. Methods: ORPHEUS is an international, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. Eligible patients are male aged ≥18 years with locally advanced or metastatic PSqCC, ECOG performance status of 0-1, adequate organ function, a life expectancy of ≥12 weeks, and with no prior treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1/2 agents. A total of 18 patients will be enrolled to receive INCMGA00012 500 mg administered intravenously on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST will be performed approximately every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter until progressive disease. The primary endpoint is objective response rate. Secondary objectives include additional efficacy outcomes (clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), 6-month PFS, duration of response, time to progression, overall survival, and maximum tumor shrinkage) and safety evaluated as per NCI-CTCAE 5.0. Exploratory objectives will evaluate efficacy based on immune-related RECIST; predictive and prognostic biomarkers; impact of INCMGA00012 on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) control in patients known to be HIV-positive. The sample size calculation is based on an exact binomial test. At least 4 responders (22.2%) among 18 patients will be adequate to justify further investigation of this strategy. The analyses were designed to attain an 80% power, with a 10% dropout rate assumption, at a nominal one-sided α level of 5%. The response probabilities for null (H0) and alternative hypotheses (H1) were H0: ≤ 5% and H1: ≥ 25%, respectively. All 18 planned patients have been enrolled since the trial began in March 2020.

Here, we report the detection rate (DR) of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3, a novel high affinity theranostic PET ligand with potential for low bladder activity. Methods: SPOTLIGHT (NCT04186845) assessed the coprimary endpoints of patient level Correct Detection Rate (CDR - % of all patients scanned with ≥1 true positive lesion) and region level Positive Predictive Value (all PET positive regions combined) of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 using histopathology and/or conventional imaging as a composite Standard of Truth (SoT). These metrics were also evaluated in a subset of patients with a histopathology-only SoT. Prespecified statistical thresholds of at least 36.5% and 62.5% were set for CDR and PPV, respectively. Overall DR stratified by PSA was also documented. Men with prostate cancer recurrence underwent PET 50-70 minutes after IV administration of 296 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3. Image guided biopsies of PET lesions took place ≤60 days post-PET and any confirmatory imaging took place ≤90 days. Three blinded central readers evaluated the scans with majority read accepted as final interpretation. A separate Truth Panel established SoT for each patient. Results: The overall DR in the 389 men (median [range] PSA, 1.10 [0.03-134.6] ng/mL) who had an evaluable 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 scan is 83% by majority read (See Table). In the 366 men (median [range] PSA, 1.27 [0.03-134.6] ng/mL) with a composite SoT, the patient level CDR is 56.8% (95% CI, 51.6-62.0), meeting the prespecified threshold. The region level PPV is 59.7% (54.7-64.7), not meeting the prespecified threshold. In the subset of patients with a histopathology-only SoT, the patient level CDR and region level PPV are higher at 81.2% (69.9-89.6) and 71.6% (62.5-80.7), respectively. Both of these values would have met the prespecified thresholds. Conclusions: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 has a clinically meaningful CDR that meets the prespecified threshold. While the region level PPV does not meet the prespecified threshold, the data in patients with a composite SoT are limited by the high proportion of prostate/bed scans (92%) that relied on conventional imaging, a suboptimal SoT. For the subset of patients with the more robust histopathology SoT for at least one region per patient, a high PPV is seen and the lower bound of the 95% CI would have exceeded the prespecified threshold. Together, these data support the clinical utility of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET in men with recurrent prostate cancer across a wide PSA range.

       "  '10Background: The TheraP trial showed that LuPSMA improved PSA≥50% response rate (PSA50-RR), PSA-PFS, and radiographic PFS (rPFS) compared with cabazitaxel in mCRPC progressing after docetaxel. Study inclusion required high PSMA uptake (SUVmax≥20) and no lesions that were FDG+ and PSMA-. Here we report on PSMA PET and FDG PET as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Methods: We prospectively analysed semi-automated quantitative PET parameters in centrally- collected 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and 18F-FDG PET in 200 eligible men. SUVmean ≥10 on PSMA PET was evaluated as a predictive biomarker for response to Lu-PSMA vs cabazitaxel. Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) ≥200mL on FDG PET was tested as a prognostic biomarker accounting for the randomly assigned treatment. Quantitative PET cut-offs were pre-specified from prior research (PMID:32140802). Responses were defined according to PSA50-RR (primary endpoint), PSA-PFS and rPFS. Binary and PFS endpoints were analyzed using logistic and Cox regression, respectively. Results: Very high PSMA uptake on PSMA PET (SUVmean≥10) was seen in 35/99 (35%) assigned LuPSMA and 30/101 (30%) assigned cabazitaxel. The odds of a response to LuPSMA vs. cabazitaxel were significantly higher for men with SUVmean≥10 (OR 12.2, 95%CI 3.4-59 vs. 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.5; p = 0.03). In men with SUVmean≥10, the PSA50-RR for LuPSMA vs. cabazitaxel were 32/35 (91%) vs. 14/30 (47%). In men with PSMA SUVmean < 10, the PSA50-RR were 33/64 (52%) vs. 23/71 (32%). High-volume metabolic disease on FDG PET (MTV ≥200mL) was seen in 30/99 (30%) assigned LuPSMA and 30/101 (30%) assigned cabazitaxel. The PSA50-RR in these men was 17/30 (57%) for LuPSMA vs. 6/30 (20%) for cabazitaxel. In comparison, the PSA50-RR for men with MTV < 200mL on FDG PET was 48/69 (70%) for LuPSMA vs. 31/71 (44%) for cabazitaxel. After accounting for treatment, the odds of a PSA50-response was lower among men with high MTV (OR 0.44; p = 0.01). The HR for PSA-PFS for LuPSMA vs cabazitaxel was 0.45 (95%CI 0.25-0.80) for SUVmean≥10 vs. 0.77 (95%CI 0.53-1.12) for SUVmean < 10 (p = 0.2). Findings were similar for rPFS. The HRs for high MTV on FDG PET adjusted for treatment were 1.44 (95%CI 1.03-2.02) for PSA-PFS (p = 0.03); and 1.79 (95%CI 1.28-2.52) for rPFS (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In men with mCRPC, PSMA SUVmean≥10 was predictive of a higher likelihood of favourable response to LuPSMA than cabazitaxel, whilst a high volume of disease on FDG PET was associated with a worse prognosis regardless of randomly assigned treatment.

       "  '11Background: Preclinical studies have shown combined anti-tumor effect through interactions between poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase and androgen receptor signaling pathways. A Phase II trial (NCT01972217) in pts with mCRPC unselected by homologous recombination repair (HRR) status who previously received docetaxel demonstrated improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) for pts treated with ola + abi vs pbo + abi (Clarke N, 2018). The Phase III PROpel study (NCT03732820) evaluates the efficacy and safety of ola + abi in the 1L mCRPC setting. Methods: PROpel is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in pts with mCRPC undergoing 1L treatment after failure of primary androgen deprivation therapy, enrolled independent of HRR status. Pts were randomized 1:1 to receive ola (300 mg twice daily [bid]) or pbo, and abi (1000 mg once daily) + prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg bid). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed rPFS with multiple secondary endpoints, including overall survival (OS). Results:796 pts were randomized to ola + abi (n=399) or pbo + abi (n=397).In this planned interim analysis, 1L treatment with ola + abi significantly prolonged rPFS vs pbo + abi in pts with mCRPC irrespective of HRR status (24.8 vs 16.6 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.81; P <0.0001). Predefined subgroup analyses showed rPFS improvement across all subgroups, including pts with (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36–0.79) and without (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59–0.97) HRR mutations detected by circulating tumor DNA testing. A sensitivity analysis of rPFS by blinded independent central review was consistent with the primary analysis (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49–0.74; P=0.004). OS is currently immature with 228 deaths (28.6%). A trend in OS favoring ola + abi was observed (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66–1.12). Secondary endpoints of time to first subsequent treatment (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61–0.90) and time to second progression-free survival or death (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51–0.94) were supportive of long-term benefits. The most common grade ≥3 adverse event (AE) reported was anemia (15.1 vs 3.3%) for ola + abi vs pbo + abi; 13.8 vs 7.8% pts, respectively, discontinued ola/pbo because of an AE. The rate of AEs leading to abi discontinuation were similar in both arms (8.5 vs 8.8%). Conclusions: At interim analysis, PROpel met its primary objective, demonstrating significant improvement in rPFS for ola + abi vs pbo + abi in pts with newly detected mCRPC who had not received prior 1L therapy, irrespective of HRR status. The safety and tolerability profile of ola + abi was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs. These results demonstrate the benefit of ola + abi without the need for HRR stratification in 1L treatment of mCRPC. Pt follow-up is ongoing for the planned OS analysis.

Combined PARPi with androgen receptor pathway targeting may also benefit unselected mCRPC. MAGNITUDE assessed whether adding NIRA to AAP improves outcomes in pts with mCRPC with or without alterations in HRR associated genes. Methods: MAGNITUDE (NCT03748641) is a randomized, double-blind phase 3 study. In eligible mCRPC pts, ≤4 mos of prior AAP for mCRPC was allowed. Pts with (HRR biomarker [BM]+; ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, HDAC2, PALB2) and without specified gene alterations (HRR BM-) were randomized 1:1 to receive NIRA 200 mg once daily + AAP or placebo (PBO) + AAP. Primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the BRCA1/2 group followed by all HRR BM+ pts. Secondary endpoints were time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (TTCC), time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) and overall survival (OS). Other endpoints included time to PSA progression (TTPP) and objective response rate (ORR). Results: 423 HRR BM+ pts were randomized to NIRA + AAP (n = 212) or PBO + AAP (n = 211). Median age was 69, 23% had prior AAP, 21% had visceral metastases, and 53% had BRCA1/2 mutations. Median follow-up was 18.6 mos. NIRA + AAP significantly improved rPFS by BICR in the BRCA1/2 subgroup and in all HRR BM+ pts, reducing the risk of progression or death by 47% (16.6 vs 10.9 mo) and 27% (16.5 vs 13.7 mo) respectively (Table), vs PBO + AAP. Investigator assessed rPFS was consistent with BICR. NIRA + AAP delayed TTCC, TTSP, and TTPP and improved ORR in HRR BM+ pts (Table). First interim analysis of OS is immature. The preplanned futility analysis in 233 HRR BM- pts showed no benefit of adding NIRA to AAP in the prespecified composite endpoint (first of PSA progression or rPFS; HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.75-1.57). No new safety signals were seen. In HRR BM+ pts, 67% and 46.4% had grade 3/4 AEs and 9% and 3.8% discontinued treatment in the NIRA + AAP and PBO + AAP arms, respectively. There were no clinically significant differences in overall quality of life (FACT-P). Conclusions: NIRA + AAP improves rPFS and other clinically relevant outcomes in pts with mCRPC and alterations in HRR associated genes. There was no evidence of benefit with the addition of NIRA to AAP in HRR BM- pts with mCRPC.

       "  '13Background: Darolutamide (DARO) is a structurally distinct and highly potent androgen receptor inhibitor that demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) and metastasis-free survival vs placebo (PBO) and a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients (pts) with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We investigated whether DARO in combination with standard androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) + docetaxel would increase OS in pts with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in the ARASENS study (NCT02799602). Methods: This international, double-blind, phase 3 study enrolled pts with mHSPC and ECOG PS 0/1 who were randomized 1:1 to DARO 600 mg twice daily or matching PBO in addition to ADT + docetaxel. Randomization was stratified by extent of disease according to TNM (M1a vs M1b vs M1c) and alkaline phosphatase levels ( < vs ≥ upper limit of normal). The primary endpoint was OS. Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to CRPC, time to pain progression, time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), and time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapies. Safety was also assessed. Results: From Nov 2016 to June 2018, 1306 pts were randomized, 651 to DARO and 655 to PBO, in combination with ADT + docetaxel. Median age was 67 y in both arms. At the primary data cutoff (Oct 25, 2021), DARO significantly decreased the risk of death by 32.5% vs PBO (HR 0.675, 95% CI 0.568–0.801; P < 0.0001). The significant improvement in OS was observed even though substantially more pts received subsequent life-prolonging systemic antineoplastic therapy in the PBO arm (75.6%) vs the DARO arm (56.8%). The significant OS benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups. In addition, DARO significantly delayed time to CRPC versus PBO (HR 0.357, 95% CI 0.302–0.421; P < 0.0001). Time to pain progression was also significantly longer with DARO vs PBO (HR, 0.792, 95% CI 0.660–0.950; P= 0.0058), as were time to first SSE and time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy. TEAEs were similar between treatment arms, and the incidences of the most common TEAEs (≥10%) were highest during the overlapping docetaxel treatment period for both arms, with grade 3/4 TEAEs of 66.1% for DARO and 63.5%for PBO, mainly due to neutropenia (33.7% vs 34.2%, respectively). TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation in 13.5% of pts in the DARO arm and 10.6% of pts in the PBO arm. Conclusions: In pts with mHSPC, early treatment combining DARO with ADT + docetaxel significantly increased OS and improved key secondary endpoints vs ADT + docetaxel alone. The incidence of TEAEs was similar in the two treatment arms. Clinical trial information: NCT02799602.',\n",

       "  '15Background: PRESIDE (NCT02288247) evaluated the benefit of continued ENZA + androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with DOC + PDN in men with mCRPC who progressed on ENZA + ADT. Methods: PRESIDE (Dec 2014–Apr 2020) enrolled chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC and disease progression while on a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist (ADT) or after bilateral orchiectomy. Pts received open-label ENZA (160 mg) + ADT in Period 1 (P1). Those with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response of ≥50% change from baseline to week (wk) 13 and later progression were eligible for Period 2 (P2). P2 pts received DOC (75 mg/m2), PDN (10 mg), and ADT, and were randomized to ENZA (160 mg) or PBO. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in P2 (from randomization to radiographic/clinical progression or death). Secondary endpoints included time to PSA progression (TTPP) [≥25% increase; absolute increase ≥2 ng/mL] and PSA response in P2. Hazard ratios (HRs) were from a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates for treatment and P1 progression. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded to assess safety. Results: 687 pts received ENZA in P1; 273 pts were randomized and 271 were treated in P2. Baseline demographics and characteristics were balanced between P2 arms. Median ENZA exposure was 62.6 wks in P1 and 36.1 and 30.1 wks in P2 with ENZA and PBO, respectively. At P2 data cut-off (Apr 30, 2020), 269 (99.3%) pts had discontinued therapy; 93 pts in each arm (ENZA, 74.4%; PBO, 75.6%) had progression. PFS was significantly improved with ENZA (HR 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53, 0.96; p = 0.027), with a higher median PFS with ENZA (9.53 months; 95% CI 8.25, 10.87) than with PBO (8.28 months; 95% CI 6.28, 8.71). ENZA also significantly delayed TTPP (8.44 vs. 6.24 months with PBO; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41, 0.82; p = 0.002) and improved PSA response at any time (ENZA, n = 76 [55.9%]; PBO, n = 50 [37.0%]). There were 46 (6.7%) deaths in P1 and 20 (ENZA, n = 13 [9.6%]; PBO, n = 7 [5.2%]) in P2. In P2, 264 (97.4%) pts had a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) [ENZA, n = 133 (97.8%); PBO, n = 131 (97.0%)]. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported by 84 (61.8%) pts on ENZA and 84 (62.2%) on PBO, and 12 (8.8%) and 9 (6.7%) pts, respectively, had TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Neutropenia (ENZA, 16.9%; PBO, 20.7%) was the most common grade 4 TEAE. Drug-related TEAEs (ENZA, 46.3%; PBO, 41.5%) were similar, and 90.4% of pts in each arm reported DOC-related TEAEs. Conclusions: Continued ENZA therapy in men with mCRPC who progressed on ENZA + ADT and received post-progression DOC + PDN significantly improved PFS compared to PBO. Treatment was well tolerated and ENZA AEs were consistent with its known safety profile. Clinical trial information: NCT02288247.',\n",

       "  '16Background: A survey of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) was conducted to map their experiences, expectations and attitudes, and to identify challenges and unmet needs in diagnosis, therapy patterns, care teams, quality of life (QoL), patient organizations and resources. Here, we describe the initial survey results and explore differences in diagnosis and therapy patterns between 3 countries. Methods: Don’tBePatient Intelligence conducted a large survey in patients with non-metastatic (M−) and metastatic (M+) PCa in Germany (DE), the UK and the US from Feb 9–Apr 10, 2021 in collaboration with patient organizations and medical experts. Recruitment was through social media advertising and patient organizations. Data were evaluated using descriptive and advanced statistics. Results: Of 33,882 survey starters, 15,824 completed, split 50.1%/49.9% in rural/urban areas. In DE/US, diagnosis through healthcare screening was more frequent than in the UK (M−/M+: DE 77%/58%; UK 42%/21%; US 77%/63%) where a higher percentage of symptomatic diagnosis was recorded (M−/M+: DE 18%/39%; UK 49%/75%; US 12%/31%). Prostatectomy was the predominant therapy in M− PCa in DE/US (71%/57%). In the UK, radiotherapy was slightly more frequent than prostatectomy (48% vs. 41%) and active surveillance was more common than in DE/US (14% vs. 6%/9%). Hormone therapy was the most common therapy in M+ PCa in all countries (DE 65%; UK 77%; US 73%). Chemotherapy was received by < 2% of patients with M− PCa in all countries but was more frequent in M+ PCa in the UK than DE/US (38% vs. 21%/27%; table). Satisfaction levels were generally high (> 80%) for all therapies in all countries. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the largest digital survey conducted in patients with PCa, allowing identification of unmet needs in the patient journey. Preliminary data suggest that rates of screening are lower in the UK than DE/US; this may correlate with the higher rate of symptomatic and potentially later-stage diagnosis, highlighting the role of routine screening. Relatively low active surveillance rates in DE/US may reflect a lower likelihood of men with M− versus M+ PCa to respond to the survey. Further analyses will include impact of differences in patient journey, trust in healthcare professionals, access to information, involvement with patient advocacy groups and QoL.

       "  '17Background: ARV-110 is a first-in-class, oral PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) protein degrader that selectively targets AR. Patients (pts) with mCRPC have limited treatment (tx) options due to decreasing AR dependence of tumors upon successive therapies. Previous phase 1 data indicated clinical activity for ARV-110 in heavily pretreated pts with mCRPC and suggested enhanced activity in pts with specific molecular profiles, eg, AR T878 and H875 mutations, leading to a phase 2 expansion (ARDENT) to further characterize ARV-110 in biomarker-defined pt subgroups. We report results of the ongoing phase 1/2 study. Methods: In phase 1, pts with mCRPC and disease progression after ≥2 prior therapies (enzalutamide and/or abiraterone required) received ARV-110 orally once or twice daily (QD or BID) in sequential cohorts (3 + 3 dose escalation design). Primary objectives were to assess ARV-110 safety and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 pts with mCRPC and 1–2 prior novel hormonal agents (NHAs) ± chemotherapy were assigned to 3 biomarker-defined subgroups: 1) AR T878 and/or H875 mutations, 2) AR L702H mutation or AR-V7 (variants not degraded by ARV-110 in nonclinical studies), and 3) wild-type AR or other AR alterations. A fourth subgroup enrolled pts based on clinical history of less prior tx: ≤1 therapy for mCRPC, 1 NHA, and no chemotherapy. Primary objective is to assess ARV-110 antitumor activity. Results: As of Aug 26, 2021, 173 pts were enrolled (67 in phase 1; 106 in phase 2). In phase 1, ARV-110 doses ranged from 35–700 mg QD or 210–420 mg BID; 420 mg QD was selected as the RP2D based on safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Across 140 biomarker-evaluable phase 1/2 pts with ≥1 month of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) follow-up, 26 with AR T878A/S and/or H875Y mutations had best PSA declines ≥50% (PSA50) and ≥30% (PSA30) of 46% and 58%, respectively, vs 10% and 23% in 114 pts without these mutations. Of 7 RECIST-evaluable pts with AR T878A/S and/or H875Y mutations, 6 had tumor shrinkage (2 with confirmed partial responses), and 4 remain on tx. Five of 19 (26%) PSA-evaluable pts in the fourth subgroup (only 1 prior NHA; no prior chemotherapy) achieved PSA50. Overall PSA50 and PSA30 response rates were 16% and 29%, respectively. There were no grade ≥4 tx-related adverse events (TRAEs) in 113 pts treated at the RP2D. The most common any grade TRAEs at the RP2D were nausea (42%; grade 3: 1%), fatigue (27%; grade 3: 1%), vomiting (23%; grade 3: 1%), decreased appetite (19%; grade 3: 0), diarrhea (15%; grade 3: 2%), and alopecia (11%). Conclusions: ARV-110, a novel AR protein degrader, demonstrates clinical activity in a post-NHA, heavily pretreated mCRPC pt population, with greatest PSA50 activity and RECIST responses in pts with AR T878 and/or H875 mutations, likely representing a particularly ARV-110–sensitive population. ARV-110 merits further investigation in pts with mCRPC. Clinical trial information: NCT0388861.',\n",

       "  '18Background: ODM-208 is a novel, oral, non-steroidal and selective inhibitor of CYP11A1, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of steroid biosynthesis. ODM-208 suppresses the production of all steroid hormones and their precursors that may activate the androgen receptor (AR) signalling pathway. This is particularly relevant in patients with AR ligand binding domain (LBD) activating somatic point mutations, a mechanism of resistance to hormone-based therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We report the first results of the first-in-man phase I CYPIDES trial. Methods: ODM-208 was examined in a dose finding phase 1 trial with a 3+3 design in patients with progressive mCRPC who had previously received ≥1 line of AR signalling inhibitor and ≥1 line of taxane-based chemotherapy. ODM-208 was administered up to 150 mg/day with glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The phase 1 endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse events, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, PSA and RECIST response, and exploratory genetic profiling. Results: By Jan 22 2021, 41 patients (median age 70 yrs.) had received ODM-208. The dose finding was completed and included doses ranging from 10 to 150 mg/day. 22 (54%) patients had previously received both abiraterone and enzalutamide, and 23 (56%) patients both docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Although tolerated by most patients, the main safety finding was adrenal insufficiency (AI). Overall, 15/41 (37%) patients experienced Grade 3 AI requiring short-term high-dose GC treatment. ODM-208 plasma exposure was dose proportional. Serum testosterone was undetectable after 4 weeks of start of ODM-208 in almost all patients, as were serum DHEA sulphate, androstenedione, 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11-ketotestosterone and pregnenolone. Overall 12/36 (33%) evaluable patients achieved a PSA decline of ≥50%. In evaluable patients with AR LBD mutation 10/15 (67%) achieved a PSA decline of ≥50%. Clinical improvement in symptoms such as pain was also observed in some men. Conclusions: Administration of ODM-208 to mCRPC men pretreated with abiraterone/enzalutamide and taxanes was highly effective in blocking the production of steroid hormones and showed promising antitumor activity, especially in men with AR mutation-positive cancers. The phase 2 dose expansion part of CYPIDES is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03436485.',\n",

       "  '19Background: Addition of abiraterone plus prednisone (AAP) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without docetaxel (D) improved overall survival in men with de novo metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer in PEACE-1 trial. An analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) was planned by an amendment in the last randomized patients to assess whether addition of AAP increases bone loss. Methods: Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either ADT + D + AAP or ADT + D (and also randomized for radiotherapy given to the prostate). BMD (g/cm2) of the lumbar spine (L), femoral neck (F) and total hip (H) were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, M6, M12 and M24 in both arms. Mean percent change in BMD values from baseline to the different time points were calculated. T-Scores were also assessed. Results: Among the 210 pts with BMD data, 182 (87%) had available data at baseline, 109 (52%) at M6, 94 (45%) at M12, and 109 (52%) at M24: 97 pts were treated with AAP and 98 without. In both arms, the median age was 65 years and 69 pts (71%) were ECOG PS 0. Median body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 and 26.5 kg/m2 in pts treated with or without AAP, respectively. BMD, T score and mean percent change in BMD values are summarized in the Table. Conclusions: This is the first prospective assessment of BMD in a randomized trial, according to an experimental treatment with AAP. Despite a bone loss increase in both arms over time, addition of AAP to ADT+D was associated with no or modest difference in bone loss during the first 2 years, compared to ADT+D. Data including fractures will be presented. Main limitations include the difficulty to reliably assess BMD in men with bone metastases, the limited sample size and the short follow-up (i.e. 2 years).

       "  '20Background: Population-level data suggest that B men are more likely to be diagnosed and die from PC. In juxtaposition, across multiple treatments for advanced PC, studies suggest B men have better survival than W men, including with novel hormone therapies (NHTs) such as ENZA. Whether improved survival is driven by better clinical response is unknown as data on racial differences in treatment response for ENZA are limited. This study assessed real-world PSA outcomes (response and progression) of ENZA-treated B vs W CN PC pts in the US. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included PC pts who initiated ENZA in the IntrinsiQ Specialty Solutions urology electronic medical records database from Sept 1, 2014 to Feb 28, 2018. The index date was the first prescription for ENZA. Patients with evidence of prior chemotherapy and/or abiraterone were excluded. Baseline characteristics, PSA response (PSA decline ≥50% or ≥90%), and clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) were assessed by race. Kaplan-Meier and Cox models adjusting for baseline characteristics were used to estimate PSA response and cPFS. Results: The study included 214 B and 1,332 W CN PC pts. Black pts were younger and had a higher baseline median PSA than W pts. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), median duration of therapy, follow-up time, and number of post-index PSA tests were similar between races. In adjusted analyses, the chances of pts achieving ≥50% PSA decline was similar, whereas a numerically higher trend was observed for ≥90% PSA decline in B pts (Table).

       "  '21Background: The term ‘financial toxicity’ or ‘hardship’ is used to describe the financial problems patients experience due to high out-of-pocket costs for their healthcare. Financial toxicity in the context of cancer treatment is an area of recent study due to the significant costs associated with these treatments, but little is known about the effect of financial toxicity on cancer prevention. We examined the effects of financial toxicity on the utilization of screening tests for prevalent cancers, including prostate and colon cancer, using a US nationally representative survey-based data source. We hypothesized that patients with more financial hardship would show an association with decreased prevalence of prostate and colon cancer screening. Methods: This cross-sectional survey-based US study included men and women aged 18+ from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) database from January – December 2018. A financial hardship score between 0 and 1 was formulated by summarizing the responses from ten financial toxicity questions including if in the past 12 months one was unable to afford prescription medication or healthcare; or if one had to skip or take less medicine to save money. A higher score was associated with a worse financial hardship score. The primary outcomes of the study were self-reported occurrence of PSA blood testing for prostate cancer screening, and occurrence of colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. Results: As shown in table, a higher financial hardship score was associated with a decreased odds ratio for having a PSA test of 0.916 (95% CI 0.867-0.967, p=0.002) and colonoscopy of 0.969 (95% CI 0.941-0.998, p=0.039). Conclusions: Worse financial hardship is associated with a decreased probability of having PSA or colonoscopy screening tests. Awareness of this specific toxicity needs to be raised, examining the association of financial toxicity and screening of prostate, colon, and other additional cancers.

       "  '22Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered standard of care in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). Over the past ten years, the approval of novel androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies has changed the treatment landscape of mPC. All these novel therapies have only been approved for use in addition to ADT. Despite these new therapeutic advances, it remains unclear how often men with mPC receive standard of care treatment with ADT. Methods: Male adults aged 20 years and older with newly diagnosed metastatic (stage IV) prostate cancer between 2009 and 2018 were identified through the California Cancer Registry (n = 15,435). Patient characteristics including age, year of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, insurance status, socioeconomic status (SES), Charlson co-morbidity score, and death within 3 months of diagnosis were analyzed. Results: 23.1% (n = 3,568) of men with newly diagnosed mPC did not receive ADT. The highest rate of receiving ADT was in men between ages 75-84 (79.6%), and the lowest rate was in men aged over 85 (72.0%) as shown in the table. There was a trend toward more newly diagnosed men receiving ADT in 2018 (81.3%) compared to 2009 (68.8%). Asian men (n = 1077) had a larger proportion of receiving ADT (79.7%), followed by American Indian men (n = 152; 76.4%), Hispanic men (n = 2,368; 75.1%), non-Hispanic White (n = 6,790; 75.6%), and lastly non-Hispanic Black men (n = 1,312; 74.8%). Men from the highest SES had the highest rate of receiving ADT (77.3%), and lowest rate was in lowest SES (73.5%). There was no significant difference among men not receiving hormonal therapy based off Charlson comorbidity score: 0 (26.0%), 1-2 (25.3%), and 3+ (24.9%). Conclusions: Despite significant advancements in the treatment of mPC in recent years, nearly a quarter of patients in California did not receive ADT, which is the backbone for all new systemic therapies. Further statistical analysis of this data set is currently ongoing. This data set might be able to help addressing some of the prostate cancer care disparities in California.

       "  '23Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically heterogeneous disease and the incidence and mortality risk varies widely among racial/ethnic groups. Among Hispanic American (HA) men, PCa accounts for nearly one-quarter of the total cancer burden; in addition, advanced stage and mortality rates are significantly higher in HA compared to Non-Hispanic White (NHW) men. Despite a decade of declining overall incidence rates, incidence rates of advanced PCa appear to be increasing over time among HA men, a similar pattern seen among Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB). Methods: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma with reported race/ethnicity, clinical staging, Gleason score ≥ 6, and PSA at diagnosis between 2010 and 2016. HAs were divided into four major subgroups: Mexican/Chicano, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Central/South Americans. NHB, Asian, and other racial groups were excluded. Statistical analysis was derived from the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of HA ethnic subgroups with metastatic presentation and primary treatment. Results: A total of 428,829 patients were included with 5,625 (1.3%) being HA. Mexican comprised 51.2% of HAs and presented with higher PSA and Gleason score at diagnosis and more advanced cT, N1 and M1 stage when compared to NHW men and other HA subgroups (all, p < 0.001) (Table). After adjusting for age, PSA, year of diagnosis, cT, N, insurance, income, education, and performance score, Mexican had 1.32 (95%CI: 1.07-1.63, p = 0.01) higher odds of initial metastatic presentation and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.55-0.85, p < 0.001) lower odds of receiving treatment compared to NHW men while no statistically significant difference was seen for the other HA subgroups. Conclusions: Even after accounting for socioeconomic disparities, Mexican men present with a more aggressive disease when compared to NHW and other HA subgroups. Our results warrant further investigations into potential biological factors affecting HA PCa as well as identifications of potential barriers to treatment for vulnerable populations.Variables N (%)NHWMexicanPuerto RicanCubanSouth or Central AmericanP-valuePatients423,204(98.7)2,880(0.7)999(0.2)477(0.1)1,269(0.3)Age65(59-71)65(59-70)65(60-70)68(62-73)64(58-71)< 0.001PSA ng/ml6.2(4.6-9.8)7.5(5.2-13.9)6.8(4.7-11.3)6.4(4.7-12.9)7.1(5-12.5)< 0.001T3-417,739(4.2)162(5.7)62(6.2)28(1.2)82(3.9)< 0.001N19,778 (2.3)113 (3.9)44 (4.4)11 (2.3)46 (3.6)< 0.001M113,673(3.2)183(6.4)52(5.2)15(3.1)58(4.6)Gleason Score< 0.001845,728(10.8)327(11.4)127(12.7)68(14.3)148(11.7)937,174(8.8)324(11.3)96(9.6)44(9.2)109(8.6)104,411(1)43(1.5)17(1.7)5(1)14(1.1) ',\n",

       "  '24Background: Somatic genetic analyses have indicated genetic distinctions in AA as compared to C patients. In the Mahal et\\xa0al. study (1) evaluating a broad spectrum of pts with tissue based assays, FOXA1 mutations were more frequent in AA men and TP53 mutations were less frequent in AA men as compared to C men. In a separate analysis by Khashab et\\xa0al. (2) conducted in prostate cancer pts receiving androgen deprivation therapy, using both tissue and ctDNA assays, the authors reported AR, TP53, SPOP, and BRCA2 were more frequently mutated in AA men as compared to C men. Herein we assessed the Guardant 360 platform in assessing ctDNA differences in AA and C men, all of whom had CRPC at the time assays were performed. Methods: Guardant 360 was used to analyze ctDNA with a cut-off of >0.5% for allelic fractions for ascertaining the presence or absence of pathogenic mutations and various amplifications. Lower allelic fractions were not analyzed given these may represent less relevant mutations. Depending on the timing of the assays (2015-2021), 70-83 genes were analyzed. All pts had CRPC and all patients were treated at Tulane Cancer Center. Chi Square analyses were used to determine statistical differences. AR, BRCA2, and TP53 were assessed but SPOP and FOXA1 were not assessable in the Guardant ctDNA assay. Both mutations and amplifications were evaluated. Results: Among men with CRPC, a total of 48 AA men and 179 C men were analyzed using ctDNA. Clear distinctions were found in the alteration reported in APC, TP53, and CDK12. TP53 was less frequently mutated and other genes were more frequently altered in the AA men. Conclusions: Using Guardant ctDNA assays in men with CRPC, clear distinctions were found in AA men as compared to C men. It is unclear why these results differ from that reported by others, however distinctions in both the assays and the populations are notable.GeneAA %C %% DifferenceOR (AA vs C)P valueAPC12.50%2.79%9.71%4.970.01CDK1210.42%1.68%6.82%6.820.01TP5325.00%41.34%16.34%0.470.04 1.

       "  '25Background: Previous studies have shown that individuals with cancer who live in rural areas have worse cancer-specific outcomes compared to their urban counterparts. Differences in access to high-quality cancer care and adequate social support may explain some of the observed disparity. Rural patients with relatives in urban areas may have better access to care via an increased ability to navigate the healthcare system than their rural counterparts without relatives in urban areas. In this study, we examine the possibility of a family-based social capital effect on genitourinary cancer survival. We hypothesized that rural patients who have family members living in urban areas have survival outcomes similar to their urban counterparts. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of individuals diagnosed with genitourinary cancers, including prostate, bladder, kidney, penile, and testicular cancers. We constructed familial networks using the Utah Population Database (UPDB). Patients were classified as living in either rural or urban areas based on the rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes associated with their zip code of residence at the time of cancer diagnosis. Adult first degree relatives (siblings, parents, children) were identified and classified as urban or rural based on the zip code or county of residence at the time of the patients’ diagnosis or, when unavailable, the county or zip code of residence before or after diagnosis. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: We identified 24,746 individuals diagnosed with genitourinary cancer between 1968-2018. Median follow-up was 8.72 years. After adjusting for sex, age, race, cancer type, health improvement index (HII), and Simpson’s diversity index, urban patients had the best OS at 5 and 10 years (reference group). Rural cancer patients without an urban first degree relative had the worst outcomes with OS hazard ratios at five and ten years of 1.4 (CI 1.23-1.58) and 1.4 (CI 1.26-1.55), respectively. Having an urban first degree relative ameliorated much of the urban-rural disparity with five- and ten-year OS hazard ratios of 1.19 (CI 1.07-1.31) and 1.12 (CI 1.03-1.21), respectively. Conclusions: Individuals diagnosed with cancer who live in rural areas have worse survival as compared to their urban counterparts, but this relationship appears to be heavily influenced by the presence or absence of relatives who live in urban areas. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms through which having an urban family member may contribute to improved cancer outcomes for rural patients. This may help in the crafting of policies that can reduce urban-rural cancer disparities.

       "  '26Background: The underrepresentation of minority populations in clinical trials negatively impacts cancer and widens inequities. We aimed to quantify the enrollment disparities in prostate cancer (PC) clinical trials over the last three decades. Methods: MEDLINE and Embase were searched to identify primary reports of prostate cancer RCTs (1989-2020). Data for trial characteristics, the proportion of trials reporting race, ethnicity and age, and the proportion of patients by race, ethnicity and age enrolled in trials were summarized using descriptive statistics. Enrollment incidence ratios (EIR), which compare trial enrollment against global estimates of incidence in age-related subgroups (acquired from the Global Burden of Disease database) and U.S. population-based estimates of racial/ethnic subgroups (acquired from the SEER 18 incidence database) were calculated. Individual trial EIRs were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to account for the substantial heterogeneity between trials. Multivariable meta-regression was used to explore associations between key trial characteristics and EIR. Annual percentage changes (APC) over the last three decades in enrollment disparities were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Analysis. Results: 281 trials from 1989 to 2020 with 99,588 patients were included in this analysis. 107 trials reported race (38%), of which only 25 trials (9%) reported data on all 5 U.S. racial categories (Black, White, Asian, Pacific Islander and Native American. 255 (91%) trials reported mean or median but only 71 trials (25%) specifically reported the enrollment proportion of older adults (age > 65 years). Clinical outcomes by race and age were reported in 9 (8%) and 37 (14%) trials, respectively. Results from meta-analyses showed that Black patients (summary EIR: 0.42 [95% CI: 0.35 - 0.51]), Hispanics (summary EIR: 0.50 [95% CI: 0.37 - 0.68]) and older adults (summary EIR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.91 - 0.99]) were underrepresented in trials relative to their population estimates. Significantly fewer Black participants (EIR for Black patients = 0.42, EIR for White patients = 0.99; p < 0.0001), Hispanic participants (EIR for Hispanics = 0.50, EIR for non-Hispanics = 1.00; p = 0.001) and older adults (EIR for older adults = 0.95, EIR for younger adults = 1.06; p = 0.037) were enrolled. Representation of Black patients decreased significantly from 1989-2019 (APC: -4.25), while Hispanic representation increased significantly from 2000-2020 (APC: 5.89). Meta-regression showed Black patients were particularly underrepresented in larger-size trials (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Black representation in PC clinical trials is less than 50% of their expected share based on cancer incidence and it has consistently decreased over last three decades, contributing to the disparities experienced by the population.',\n",

       "  '27Background: African American (AA) men with prostate cancer (PC) present with more advanced disease and have worse survival than comparable non-Hispanic White (White) men. Recent studies suggest that receiving care within an equal access setting may attenuate these disparities. We hypothesize that AA men receiving care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) will have improved outcomes compared to AA men receiving care in the general population as assessed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Methods: We identified AA men diagnosed with PC between 2004 and 2015 in the VHA and SEER. For comparisons of covariate distributions across subgroups, we used the chi-squared test with continuity correction. We analyzed the cumulative incidence (with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of PC specific mortality (PCSM) in the VHA and SEER. Additionally, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models controlling for demographic information were performed. Results: The cohort included 85,409 AA men (VHA: 27,415, SEER: 57,994). Median follow-up was 4.79 years in the VHA and 5.16 years in SEER. In the VHA, AA men were more likely to present with localized disease (VHA 94.7% vs SEER 86.4%, p < 0.001) and less likely to have metastatic disease (3.2% vs 4.3%, p < 0.001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of PCSM was lower for patients in the VHA (VHA: 3.8% [CI: 3.5-4.1%] vs. SEER: 5.0% [CI: 4.8-5.2%], p < 0.001). The PCSM difference was largest in men with metastatic disease. In metastatic patients, cumulative incidence of PCSM at five years was significantly lower in the VHA (VHA 52.5% [CI: 48.0-56.5%] vs. SEER 64.8% [CI: 62.3-67.1%], p < 0.001). In contrast, AA men with localized disease had similar PCSM in the VHA and SEER (VHA 2.4% [CI: 2.2-2.6%] vs. SEER 2.6% [CI: 2.4-2.7%], p = 0.09 at five years). On multivariable analysis, VHA system was associated with lower PCSM [Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.91, p < 0.001]. There was a significant interaction between VHA system and distant metastases at diagnosis [p < 0.001] indicating larger differences in PCSM by healthcare system in metastatic patients as compared to localized patients. VHA system was associated with reduced PCSM in metastatic patients [HR 0.84, p < 0.001] but not in localized patients [HR 0.96, p = 0.13]. Conclusions: AA men in the VHA had a significantly lower incidence of PCSM than those in the SEER database, especially for those who presented with distant metastases at diagnosis. Future work should examine how cost and access to care affect disparities in outcomes for AA men.',\n",

       "  '28Background: Amongst all cancers in men, prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer, and the second leading cause of death. Racial disparities in PCa care in the United States (US) are known to exist. However, it is not clear if this disparity is also noted specifically in patients diagnosed with metastatic PCa (metaPCa). We analyzed the Surveillance Epidemiology and End results Program (SEER) 18 registry, to determine the racial disparity in survival of AA patients diagnosed with metaPCa compared to other races recorded in this registry. Methods: Cancer incidence data was obtained from the SEER 18 registry (2000-2018). The data was analyzed using StataMP 16 (StataCorp) software. Demographic and clinical outcomes were recorded from the registry. We performed univariate Cox regression using proportional hazard model and obtained Kaplan Meier curves to look at the difference in survival based on different age groups and race. Results: A total of 51,979 cases were identified with metaPCa, out of whom 75.8% were Whites. 40,579 deaths were recorded. Mean age group of patients with metaPCa were 70-74 years. Grade 3 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma was noted in 54.6% patients. There was no statistically significant difference in survival of AA patients with metaPCa compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.99; 95%CI 0.96,1.03 p = 0.71) or Alaskan and American Natives (AIAN) with metaPCa (HR:1.048; 95%CI 0.91,1.21 p = 0.539). AA with metaPCa had a statistically better outcome compared to Asian and Pacific Islanders with metaPCa (HR:0.775; 95%CI 0.731,0.821 p = 0.00). Amongst patients with less than 65 years of age with metaPCa, AA patients had statistically better survival than NHW (HR: 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.98 p = 0.05). No statistically supported racial disparity in survival was observed in patients above 65 years with metaPCa (AA to NHW patients- HR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.96,1.03 p = 0.71). Conclusions: Although racial disparities exist in survival of all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, when it comes to those with metaPCA, there is no statistically supported racial disparity amongst AA patients compared to NHW, except for those who are younger than 65 years where white patients have a worse outcome compared to AA diagnosed with metaPCa.',\n",

       "  '29Background: Early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) is typically detected on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and subsequent prostate biopsy, healthcare interventions that are considered routine elective procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine healthcare screenings and interventions. We sought to determine whether delayed screening and diagnostic workup of PCa was associated with increased rates of incident PCa, high-grade Gleason, and metastatic disease at diagnosis. Methods: We used the Corporate Data Warehouse of the Veterans Health Administration to collect PSA, prostate biopsy, PCa diagnosis, Gleason score, and metastasis information of White and Black Veterans aged 40 years or older newly diagnosed with PCa from January 2019 through June 2021. For each month, we calculated rates of PSA, prostate biopsy, and incident PCa per 100,000 men and plotted monthly rates by race. We performed descriptive analyses to compare age at first PSA, age at diagnosis, baseline PSA, Gleason scores, and metastasis pre- and post-January 2020, the month in which the U.S. declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. Results: The decrease in the rate of PSA screening immediately after January 2020 was similar in both White and Black Veterans (7% vs. 6%). However, the magnitude of reduction in the rate of prostate biopsy and the rate diagnosis of incident PCa were five times larger among Black Veterans compared to White Veterans (11% vs. 2% for both biopsy and diagnosis rates). Among the 17,771 White and 9,610 Black Veterans with incident PCa, the rate of Gleason of 4+3 or greater and the rate of metastatic disease at diagnosis increased three months after the pandemic in both race groups with comparable magnitude (2-3% increase in high-grade Gleason, 1% increase in metastatic disease). Conclusions: Utilization patterns indicated that while the decrease in PSA screening after the pandemic was similar in White and Black Veterans, reductions in prostate biopsy and diagnosis of incident PCa were five times greater in Blacks than Whites. Further research including risk-adjusted modeling is needed to determine whether Black Veterans were disproportionately affected by the pandemic-related disruptions in PSA screening and diagnostic workup of prostate cancer.Patient characteristics of incident prostate cancer cases by race before and three months after COVID-19 pandemic.WhiteBlackPrePostPrePostNumber of patients10,3167,4555,3634,247Gleason≥ 4+3 (%)4297 (42)3348 (45)2164 (40)1775 (42)Metastatic at diagnosis (%)1086 (11)901 (12)433 (8)402 (9)Age at first PSA, median (IQR)59 (11)59 (11)53 (12)53 (11)Age at diagnosis, median (IQR)70 (7)71 (8)65 (10)65 (11)PSA at diagnosis, median (IQR)7.0 (6.2)7.3 (6.7)7.2 (6.8)7.3 (7.4) ',\n",

       "  '30Background: In the United States of America (USA), prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and it remained the second leading cause of cancer related mortality. It has a disproportionate burden of disease among minorities. In particular, African American (AA) men have a higher incidence and more aggressive disease course. Our study compares trends in prostate cancer mortality in the United States of America (USA) by race and state from 1999 to 2019. Methods: We used the Center for Disease Control (CDC) WONDER database using ICD-10 code C61 to extract mortality data for malignant prostate cancer. Age standardized death rates (ASDRs) are reported per 100,000 population using the USA standard population. ASDRs were divided into American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African American and, Whites and reported by year for each state. Due to the lack of available data in many states, state-wise analyses were done for white and African American men only. We used Joinpoint regression analysis for trends comparison. Results: Between 1999 and 2019, data was analyzed from 50 states of the USA, of which four started collecting data from 2000, one from 2001, one from 2008, and one from 2009. Three states had data until 2018 only. Data was missing for African American men in 17 states. In 2019, ASDR in African American (13.4/100,000) was significantly higher than Whites (7.3/100,000) (p<0.001). The highest ASDR for African American was observed in Nebraska (33.5/100,000), followed by Wisconsin (17.7/100,000). In contrast, the highest ASDR for whites was observed in Alaska (11/100,000), followed by Utah (10.5/100,000) ASDR decreased by 31.8% in White men at the national level, compared to a decline of 44.6% in African American men. ASDR decreased in all states for both races. For White men, the widest drops were in South Dakota (-45.9%) and Kentucky (-47.0%), and the lowest declines in New Hampshire (-11.5%) and Alaska (-16.0%). For African American men, the largest decreases were in Delaware (-57.8%) and Nevada (-55.3%), and the smallest declines were in Kentucky (-14.9%) and Wisconsin (-20.3%). Conclusions: During the last 20 years, the mortality rate from prostate cancer has consistently dropped in all the states of the USA and for all races. Even though a higher decrease in ASDR was observed in the African American and Asian racial groups, ASDR is still higher in African Americans as compared to Whites.Prostate cancer age-standardized death rate in the USA.

       "  '31Background: 4Kscore was developed and validated agnostic to prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) findings, with current clinical paradigms utilizing a value of 7.5% to delineate the potential for high-grade disease. A growing body of evidence suggests improved diagnostic utility when used in conjunction with mpMRI results. Incorporation of mpMRI PIRADS scores may have potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy of 4Kscore, especially for non-definitive lesions. This study aims to examine the optimal 4Kscore threshold in PIRADS 3/4 lesions to maximize test utility and help guide clinical decision-making. Methods: A single-institution review of all patients with recorded 4Kscore, prostate MRI with dominant PIRADS 3/4 lesions, and final biopsy pathology from 2016-2020 was conducted from an IRB-approved database. Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as Gleason score ≥3+4 on final biopsy. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the primary data point was chosen to maximize sensitivity and specificity. Results: 88 patients with dominant PIRADS 3 (n = 40) or PIRADS 4 (n = 48) lesions were identified. For patients with PIRADS 3 lesions, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8083 (p < 0.0039) with optimal 4Kscore threshold to detect csPCa as 18.5% (sensitivity = 70.00%, specificity = 80.00%). Negative predictive value (NPV) at 4Kscore of 18.5% in PIRADS 3 lesions was 0.93. In patients with dominant PIRADS 4 lesions, AUC was 0.7735 (p < 0.002), and optimal threshold to detect csPCa was 21.5% (sensitivity = 70.59%, specificity = 76.67%). NPV at 4Kscore of 21.5% in PIRADS 4 lesions was 0.82. Conclusions: Stratification of mpMRI PIRADS 3/4 lesions suggests that utilization of more permissive 4Kscore thresholds can improve prediction of csPCa without sacrificing NPV, especially for PIRADS 3 lesions. These findings may enhance risk-adapted prostate cancer screening, reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies, and optimize clinical management.',\n",

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a multicenter dataset 270 men with mCRPC treated with Lu-177 PSMA (Gafita A, Lancet Oncol 2021). For quantitative analysis, semi-automatic segmentation software (qPSMA) divided men into three groups according to the SUVmean ratio of whole-body-tumor to parotid glands: (high) > 1.5; (intermediate) 0.5 - 1.5; (low) < 0.5. For visual analysis, ten nuclear medicine physicians with (n = 5) and without (n = 5) clinical experience in Lu-177 PSMA RLT ( > 50 cases) read each baseline PSMA PET 3D maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, and classified the patients into three groups: (high) most ( > 80%) of the lesions show higher uptake than parotid glands; (intermediate) neither “low” nor “high”; (low) most ( > 80%) of the lesions show lower uptake than parotid glands. In case of inter-reader disagreement, a majority vote was used. Outcome measures included PSA-progression free-survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival (OS), and PSA decline of ≥50% (PSA50). Fisher’s exact test and Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log-rank test was performed for PSA50 and survival analysis, respectively. Results: 237 men were analyzed after excluding 33 men with more than half of the parotid glands out of the PET scan field-of-view. The number of the patients in the high, intermediate, and low groups were 106/237 (44.7%), 96 (40.5%), and 35 (14.8%) for visual criteria, and 56 (23.6%), 163 (68.8%), and 18 (7.6%) for quantitative analysis, respectively. The inter- and intra-readers reproducibility of the visual scoring showed substantial (Fleiss’ weighted Kappa: 0.68) and almost perfect (Cohen's weighted Kappa (mean): 0.83) agreement, respectively. The median PSA-PFS was 6.7, 3.8, and 1.9 months (p < 0.001); and 7.2, 4.0, and 1.9 months (p < 0.001) in the high, intermediate, and low expression groups by visual and quantitative criteria, respectively. The PSA50 was 63.2%, 33.3%, and 17.1% (p < 0.001), and 69.6%, 38.7%, and 16.7% (p < 0.001) in the high, intermediate, and low expression groups by visual and quantitative criteria, respectively. OS was longer in the high PSMA expression group than in the intermediate + low (i.e., non-high) group by visual (14.3 vs.11.0 months (p = 0.038)) and quantitative criteria (15.0 vs. 11.7 months (p = 0.013)). Conclusions: Tumor-to-parotid uptake using a simple visual or semi-quantitative measure is a valuable prognostic biomarker for response in men with mCRPC treated with Lu-177 PSMA RLT.\",\n",

       "  '33Background: About a half of men with prostate cancer progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) one year after the initiation of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), whereas approximately 20 % of men keep the sensitivity to ADT more than 5 years. Several novel androgen-receptor-axis-targeted agents (ARATAs) were developed for the treatment of mCRPC, and improved overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRPC; however, to which patients these ARATAs were more beneficial is yet to be determined. We conducted this study to identify factors that predict effectiveness from ARATAs for mCRPC. Methods: We previously performed a multicenter study to determine prognostic factors including bone scan index (BSI) in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (n = 148) and mCRPC (n = 99), which showed that BSI was one of the significant determinants of 3-year OS (PROSTAT-BSI study). The patients with mHSPC progressed to mCRPC (n = 101). Among these mCRPC patients, 69 patients received treatments with or without ARATAs, because the patients were recruited before and after approval of ARATAs in Japan. We used the data of the 69 patients to identify predictors for effective use of ARTA. The cohort was divided into two groups according to patient factors by several thresholds, and these two cohorts were further divided into two subgroups: those who received and did not receive ARATAs (abiraterone or enzalutamide). OS was compared between these two cohort groups to evaluate contribution of each factor. Categorical values were analyzed in the same way, although no threshold setting was required. Results: Factors, in which the significant treatment effect from ARATAs was observed between subgroups in only one group (eg. age < 71.4 vs age ≥ 71.4), were age ( < 71.4 years); serum levels of C-reactive protein (≥0.16 ng/mL), alkaline phosphatase (≥548 U/L), and type 1 collagen C-terminal telopeptide ( < 6.4 ng/mL); time to PSA progression after ADT ( < 8.9 months); lowest PSA level (≥1 ng/mL) after ADT; and rate of PSA decline 3 month after ADT ( <.987). Whereas, no significant difference was observed between two groups in cohorts divided by hemoglobin level, PSA before ADT, Gleason score, and BSI. Conclusions: This study identified the predictors of the effectiveness from ARATAs. In addition, the number of bone metastases (corresponding to BSI) and Gleason score, which were considered as high-risk factors in the LATITUDE study and disease volume in the CHAARTED criteria, may not be useful for predicting the effectiveness from ARATAs.',\n",

       "  '34Background: Growing evidence proved the efficacy of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-guided targeted biopsy (TB) in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, but there is no direct comparison between mpMRI-TB and PSMA PET/CT-TB. Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) highly expressed in PCa, which can compensate for the unstable expression of PSMA in PCa. Therefore, we designed a study to compare the efficiency of mpMRI-TB, dual-Tracer (GRPR and PSMA) PET/CT-TB, systematic biopsy, and combined biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods: 112 suspicious PCa patients were enrolled from September 2020 and June 2021 in this prospective and comparative effectiveness study. Patients with positive dual-tracer PET/CT or mpMRI results underwent TB and all enrolled patients underwent SB after TB. The primary outcome was the detection rates of PCa in different biopsy strategies. Secondary outcomes were the performance of three imaging methods, omission diagnostic rates, and upgrading and downgrading of biopsy samples relative to those of prostatectomy specimens in different biopsy strategies. Results: In 112 men, clinically significant PCa (grade group≥2) accounted for 34.82% (39/112) and nonclinically significant PCa (grade group = 1) accounted for 4.46% (5/112). 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT-TB achieved higher PCa detection rate (69.77%) and positive ratio of biopsy cores (0.44) compared with SB (39.29% and 0.12) and mpMRI-TB (36.14% and 0.23), respectively (P < 0.005). Dual-tracer PET/CT as a triage test avoided 52.67% (59/112) unnecessary biopsy, whereas dual-tracer PET/CT-TB plus SB achieved high detection rate (77.36%) without misdiagnosis of csPCa. Conclusions: Dual-tracer PET/CT could screen patients for avoiding unnecessary biopsy. Dual-tracer PET/CT-TB plus SB might be a more effective and promising strategy for definite diagnosis of clinically significant PCa than mpMRI-TB.',\n",

       "  '35Background: The OSPREY clinical trial was a phase 2/3 prospective study of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT using piflufolastat F 18. Piflufolastat F 18 (aka 18F-DCFPyL or PyL) is a novel PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceutical approved for imaging of PCa pts both at initial staging and for disease recurrence. Here we describe SUV results by biopsy status, baseline PSA levels, and Gleason score (GS). Methods: Piflufolastat F 18 -PET/CT was evaluated in men with NCCN high-risk PCa scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (RP-PLND) (Cohort A) and men with radiologically suspected recurrent/metastatic PCa (Cohort B). A single IV dose of 9 mCi (333 MBq) of piflufolastat F 18 was administered followed by PET/CT acquisition 1-2 hours later. Piflufolastat F 18 uptake in various lesion locations as defined by maximum and peak SUV (SUVmax, SUVpeak) were determined by three blinded, independent central readers for each tissue (e.g., bone, lymph nodes (LN), soft tissue). To measure SUVs, the reader placed a volume of interest (VOI) on each identified lesion. SUVmax was defined as the maximum single-voxel SUV within the VOI. SUVpeak within the VOI was defined as the average SUV within a fixed-sized VOI (1 cm diameter sphere), representing the cluster with the highest average SUV. Results: 345 men underwent piflufolastat F 18-PET/CT. Cohort B (n = 93 evaluable) SUVmax and SUVpeak were significantly higher for biopsy positive (+) (one biopsy lesion/pt) when compared to biopsy negative (-) lesions from bone and LN. SUVpeak for biopsied bone and LN (Cohort B) appeared to increase with rising baseline PSA. In high-risk PCa pts, SUVpeak for prostate (Cohort A; n = 252 evaluable) increased with baseline PSA and were highest for GS 9-10 (Table). Conclusions: Piflufolastat F 18-PET/CT uptake was significantly higher in biopsy + lesions and increased with baseline PSA. Prostate SUVpeak was highest for GS 9-10.

       "  '36Background: The kinetics of PSMA PET uptake in prostate cancer lesions after radiation therapy (RT) is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the patterns of PSMA PET uptake in irradiated lesions using serial PSMA PET/CT scans. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study that included patients with prostate cancer who underwent one PSMA PET/CT scan before RT and at least one other scan after RT between November 2016 and July 2021. One reader (M.H.) analyzed the target lesions uptake by visual criteria (uptake above background) and semi-quantitative analysis. Lesions with and without residual uptake were compared for 1) time-interval after RT, 2) lesion tissue type (prostate, prostate bed, lymph node, and bone), 3) RT type (stereotactic body RT, intensity-modulated RT, three-dimensional conformal RT, and proton therapy), 4) baseline uptake intensity (SUVmax), and 5) PSMA-derived tumor volume (PSMA-TV). Lesions with residual uptake were followed-up. Diagnosis of recurrence was made by biopsy or subsequent PSMA PET/CT where increased PSMA uptake from the previous scan was considered a recurrence. Results: A total of 108 patients with available clinical and imaging data on 257 irradiated lesions (lymph node: n = 126; bone: n = 98; prostate: n = 25; prostate bed: n = 8) were included. The median time from end of RT to follow-up PET was 10.6 (range: 0.4-51.7) months. Residual uptake after RT was observed in 90/257 (35.0%) of the irradiated lesions. The mean decrease in SUVmax on the follow-up PET performed at < 3, 3-6, 6-9, and 9-12 months post-RT were 41.4%, 53.8%, 65.6%, and 69.7% (p = 0.004). Residual uptake was more commonly seen in the prostate (prostate 68.0%; bone 40.8%; prostate bed 25.0%; lymph node 24.8%, p < 0001), and associated with higher baseline uptake and lesion size: (residual uptake pos. vs neg.) SUVmax 9.5 vs 6.4, p < 0.001; PSMA-TV 1.7 vs 1.0 ml, p = 0.002. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, shorter time after RT, higher baseline SUVmax, and target lesions in the prostate were independently associated with residual uptake. Among the lesions with residual uptake, 28/90 (31.1%) lesions were subsequently evaluated by biopsy and/or follow-up PSMA PET, and 6/28 (21.4%) lesions were eventually diagnosed as recurrence. Risk factors of recurrence were a residual uptake observed after a long time-interval from the end of RT (recurrence vs non-recurrence: 15.8 vs 3.7 months, p = 0.002) in the prostate lesion (prostate 50.0%; bone 12.5%; lymph node 0.0%, p = 0.044). When using a cutoff value of > 8.6 months after RT, the presence of residual uptake was diagnostic of recurrence with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.86 (AUC: 0.92). Conclusions: The PSMA PET uptake of irradiated lesion decreases gradually over one year, while the uptake in the prostate tends to remain longer than in bone and lymph node lesions. A persistent uptake 9-12 months after RT is highly suggestive of recurrence.',\n",

       "  '37Background: We have previously reported a dose-intense single-cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was effective in pretreated patients with mCRPC without requiring PSMA-positive imaging for enrollment. Prior post-hoc analyses of these data using approximate quantification of exclusively the most PSMA-positive disease sites have demonstrated associations between PSA response and PFS with pre-treatment 68Ga-PSMA11-PET signal. Greater sophistication in pre- and post-treatment evaluation of PSMA-expression in tumor and normal organs may allow for better patient selection and prediction of toxicities. Methods: A total of 50 patients were treated on a phase I/II study of fractionated-dose (D1, 15) 177Lu-617-PSMA. Quantification using artificial intelligence (AI) were used to measure pre- and post-treatment PSMA signal intensity. Scoring cutoffs with confidence intervals around scan variation were empirically established from a subset of test/re-test of subjects within 24h without intervening therapy. A variety of measurements were performed including SUVmean across all detectable tumor lesions, volume of lesions, and SUVtotal (Total + Volume), as well as select normal organs and changes after treatment. Associations with survival were tested via Cox proportional hazard models in univariate analyses and associations with adverse events (AEs) and PSA responses were via assessed via Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results: 13 subjects were selected to complete AI-based quantification and associated survival analyses. Among these, 10 (77%) experienced any PSA decline, with 8 (62%) with PSA50 and 3 (23%)with PSA90. Median overall survival (OS) was 17.0 mos (10, NA) via Kaplan-Meier estimates. In univariate analysis, pretreatment SUVmean was associated with improved PFS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.90, p = 0.009) and OS (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.00, p = 0.048). The metrics most strongly associated with PSA50 were pretreatment SUVmean (median [IQR]: 7.66 [6.52, 10.54] v 3.50 [3.02, 3.56], p = 0.019) and SUV Total (14982 [11110, 20595] v 1303 [576, 1512], p = 0.019), and change in Volume (-27 [-44, -20] v 145 [38, 154], p = 0.006) and SUVtotal (-57 [-67, -35] v 132 [9, 269], p = 0.030). Subjects with xerostomia had higher salivary gland SUVmax (pretreatment and change in after treatment). Those with pain flare had lower pretreatment SUV scores (Mean, Max, Total) in unaffected portions of bony skeleton. Conclusions: Sophisticated AI-based quantification analysis of PSMA expression on pre- and post-treatment 68Ga-PSMA11-PETs demonstrate associations with treatment efficacy (PSA response, OS), and associations between patient experience (AEs) and PSMA expression in non-tumor tissues. Expansion of this algorithm to a larger patient cohort may improve our ability to anticipate toxicity by body-wide PSMA detection and predict treatment response.

       "  '38Background: The present study evaluates the potential role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT to detect pelvic lymph node metastases in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve high risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients prior to radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Methods: A total of 165 men with newly diagnosed high risk PCa (ISUP grade 4/5, PSA > 20 ng/ml or ≥cT3a) were included in this retrospective analysis. All men had undergone a transperineal MR fusion biopsy and all men underwent RPE with epLND. Patients with neoadjuvant ADT, TRUS guided biopsies, previous radiation or surgeries in the small pelvis were excluded. Imaging findings and pathohistological findings were correlated and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The correlation of clinical and biopsy characteristics with PSMA PET/CT. Results: The median PSA was 24.5 (6.7-185) ng/ml, the median number of dissected lymph nodes was 21-5 (14-45). A total of 68/165 (41,2%) patients had lymph node metastases (LNM) of which 43 (63.2%) were positive on PSMA-PET/CT whereas 25 (36.8%) LNM were negative on PSMA PET/CT. 97/165 (58.8%) pts had pN0 disease of whom 93 (95.9%) and 3 (4.1%) demonstrated negative and positive PSMA PE/CT findings, resp. n = 47 had positive PSMA PET/CT and 40 (85.1%) demonstrated LNM, 7 (14.9%) had pN0 disease. N = 118 had negative PSMA PET/CT of which 93 (78.8%) and 25 (21.2%) were true and false negative, resp. Sensitivity was 63.2%, specificity was 97.0%, and positive and negative predictive values were 93.5% and 78,8%, respectively. 3564 lymph nodes were resected, 149 (4.2%) had LNM. 88/149 (59.1%) were detected on PSMA PET/CT and 61 (40.9%) were undetected. On a per lymph node base, sensitivity and specificity were 40.4% and 94.5%, resp; positive and negative predictive values were 59.1% and 97.3%. Conclusions: PSMA-PET/CT has a high reliability to identify patients with high risk PCA and LNM. If a positive lesion is detected, epLND is mandatory due to high frequency of undetected small LNM. PSMA-PET/CT, is superior to standard imaging and it might replace CT/MRI of the small pelvis.',\n",

       "  '39Background: The VISION trial showed that 177Lu-PSMA can prolong survival and improve the quality of life of patients with advanced mCRPC. The VISION trial used PSMA-PET/CT to select patients for inclusion. Here, we evaluated the outcome of patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA who would have been screen failure (SF) by VISION-PET criteria. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in our institutional database of patients treated with ≥1 cycle of 177LuPSMA between November 2017 and July 2021 (n = 74) and a multicenter dataset published previously (n = 230) (Gafita A, Lancet Oncol 2021). One dual certified reader (M.H.) in nuclear medicine and radiology blinded for patient outcomes reviewed the baseline PSMA-PET/CT scans to define eligible (VISION-PET-E) vs SF (VISION-PET-SF) patients. VISION-PET- SF criteria were defined as:1) absence of metastatic lesion with uptake > liver background (i.e., low PSMA expression) or 2) presence of ≥ 1 metastatic lesion measurable by CT (≥ 1 cm for bone lesions with soft-tissue component (M1b) and solid/visceral organs lesions (M1c); ≥ 2.5 cm for lymph nodes lesions (N1-M1a)) with uptake ≤ liver background (i.e., PSMA-negative lesions). Outcome measures included PSA response rates (decline of ≥50% (PSA50RR) and any decline (anyPSARR)), PSA-progression free-survival (PSA-PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: 3/304 patients (1%) were excluded (lost to follow-up (n = 2), missing DICOM CT images (n = 1)). 272/301 (90.4%) of the analyzed patients were VISION-PET-E while 29/301 (9.6%) were VISION-PET-SF: 8/301 (2.7%) with low PSMA expression and 21/301 (7.0%) with PSMA-negative lesions, respectively. The median follow-up time was 12.6 months (IQR: 7.0-21.3, range: 0.6-62.3). VISION-PET-SF patients had a worse PSA50RR (21% vs 50%; p = 0.005), anyPSARR (41% vs 71%; p = 0.003), median PSA PFS (2.1 months (1.1-3.3) vs. 4.1 (4.0-5.8); p = 0.023)), and tended to have a shorter median OS (9.6 months (4.7-14.0) vs. 14.2 (12.6-15.9); p = 0.16) than the VISION-PET-E patients. Patients with PSMA-negative lesion (n = 21) tended to have a worse response than those with low PSMA expression (n = 8): median OS 8.2 months (4.4-11.0) vs. NA (11.1-NA) (p = 0.034), median PSA-PFS 1.8 months (1.4-3.3) vs. 2.8 (1.1-5.7) (p = 0.44), PSA50RR 19% vs 25% (p = 1.00), and any PSARR 38% vs 50% (p = 0.68). Conclusions: Some have argued that the low SF rate of 12.6% (126/1003) in the VISION trial may obviate the need for PSMA-PET eligibility screening prior to 177Lu-PSMA. Here we report that VISION-PET-SF patients had worse outcomes than VISION-PET-E patients in response to 177Lu-PSMA therapy. The best management of patients with negative or low PSMA expressing lesions is unknown. Combining 177Lu-PSMA with external-beam RT and/or with other systemic therapy may be an effective therapeutic approach. Refinements in patient selection for 177Lu-PSMA are needed to optimize patient outcomes.',\n",

       "  '40Background: Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) comprises distinct molecular actionable subtypes. Radboudumc, a tertiary referral center for PCa, hosts a Molecular Tumor Board (MTB), and frequently sees CRPC patients (pts) for referral for genetic testing. In the period 2017-2020, almost 50% of heavily pre-treated CRPC pts received a recommendation for a genetically matched therapy (GMT). In 2020 we initiated the PROMPT trial (NCT04746300) to prospectively study the impact of routine early molecular characterization in CRPC. Increased GMT utilization of targeted- and immunotherapy may improve outcome and quality of life of pts with metastatic CRPC, and lead to lower medical resource utilization (MRU). Here we report on first results from our observational trial. Methods: Within the PROMPT trial, prior to receiving first- or second line standard of care CRPC therapy, up to 300 pts were offered molecular tumor characterization with the TruSightOncology 500 panel (TSO500). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate or metastatic tissue biopsies were used, preferably newly obtained. To assess both mutations and copy number alterations, the TSO500 required a minimal tumor cell percentage (TC%) of 30%. Results were discussed within the Radboudumc MTB for GMT recommendation. Actionable targets were defined per Precision Medicine Working group criteria and, when druggable, within the Drug Rediscovery Protocol trial (NCT02925234). All pts with tumor mutations carrying with a risk for cancer predisposition were referred for genetic counselling. Follow-up with patient-reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30, EQ5D, BPI & EPIC-26 questionnaires) and MRU was conducted every 3 months until withdrawal or death. Results: From February 2020 until October 2021 we included 284 consecutive CRPC pts with a median age of 70 years (range 46-86) with a median follow-up of 6.8 months. Newly obtained biopsies and archival material was used in 131 and 126 pts, respectively. Median TC% was 60% (range: 20-90%). TSO500 results could be reported in 254 (89%) cases, with at least one putative clinically relevant aberration in 188 evaluable pts (74%). In 100 pts (39,4%) ≥ 1 druggable target was found. Most common actionable alterations were in PTEN (19%), BRCA2 (9%) or in mismatch-repair genes or resulting in high tumor mutational burden (5%). Out of the 100 druggable pts, 31 pts (31%) initiated a form of GMT, 4 pts (4%; 2 BRCA2, 2 PTEN) died prior to receiving GMT, in 65 pts (65%) GMT is pending as they receive standard of care. Conclusions: Routine molecular profiling early in the CRPC setting is feasible in a tertiary referral center with a MTB and high volume of CRPC pts. Almost 40% CRPC pts harbored an actionable target with 31% of these pts already allocated to a GMT. Failure rates of NGS were low at 11%.',\n",

       "  '41Background: Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is becoming an attractive option for men seeking treatments that minimize the morbidity of whole gland therapy. Prostate MRI reports should include lesion location, presence of bilateral extension and presence of multifocality as these radiographic features are essential in selecting appropriate candidacy. We aim to evaluate concordance of disease between MRI and final pathology reports. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of pathology reports from radical prostatectomies (RP) performed at our institution between 2016-2019, in patients whom also underwent pre-operative prostate MRI’s. The number and locations of PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions described in MRI reports were compared against the RP findings and assessed for disease concordance in terms of lesion location, extent (unilateral vs. bilateral extent) and/or the presence of tumor multifocality. Fischer’s exact test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 1593 patients underwent RP, among which 416 (26.1%) had preoperative prostate MRI’s. A majority (65.3%) (n = 273/416) of MRI’s reported a single PI-RADS > 3 lesion, 51/416 (12.3%) had negative MRI’s and 22.1% (92/416) described >2 PI-RADS ≥ 3 lesions. A total of n = 388/416 (93.2%) had detailed descriptions of their MRI and path reports for comparative analysis. MRI and final path tumor concordance with respect to unifocal extent or multifocality was low at 37.2%. When a single PI-RADS > 3 lesion was described, concordance with final path was 37.6% as compared to 55.6% when >2 lesions were described (p = 0.006). Discordant findings at final path included the presence of tumor multifocality (80.7%) or the extent of a unifocal lesion (19.3%). Lesions crossing the midline were uncommonly reported on MRI (16%). When prostate midline assessment was included in the evaluation of lesion extent, the degree of concordance with final pathology improved from 33.3% to 64.2% (p = 0.038). Conclusions: Prostate MRI reports have a large discordance with RP reports. Tumor multifocality and/or unifocal disease crossing the midline may not hold significant meaning if the disease is ultimately organ confined and the treatment is aimed at the whole gland. However, in the context of focal therapy, these findings are of germane importance.

Methods: This was an international, multicenter, retrospective study. 124 men with mCRPC who underwent 177Lu-PSMA therapy and received PSMA-PET/CT at baseline (bPET) and at interim at 12 weeks (iPET) were included. Pairs of bPET and iPET were interpreted by consensus among three blinded readers for appearance of new lesions. Tumor lesions were segmented and total PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-VOL) was obtained. Appearance of new lesions and changes in PSMA-VOL were combined to develop RECIP 1.0, which was defined as: complete response (RECIP-CR: absence of any PSMA-ligand uptake on iPET), partial response (PSMA-PR: decline ≥30% in PSMA-VOL and no appearance of new lesions), progressive disease (RECIP-PD: increase ≥20% in PSMA-VOL and appearance of new lesions), stable disease (RECIP-SD: any condition but RECIP-PR or RECIP-PD). Changes in PSA levels at 12 weeks by PCWG3 were recorded. Responses by PSA+RECIP were defined as: response (PSA decline ≥50% or RECIP-PR/CR) and progression (PSA increase ≥25% or RECIP-PD). Study's primary outcome measure was the prognostic value of RECIP 1.0 for overall survival (OS). Secondary outcome measure was the prognostic accuracy (C-index) of PSA+RECIP vs PSA responses. Results: Patients with progressive disease (RECIP-PD; n=39; 8.3 mo) had shorter OS compared to patients with stable disease (RECIP-SD; n=47; 13.1 mo; p<0.001) and to those with partial response (RECIP-PR; n=38; 21.7 mo; p<0.001). PSA+RECIP had superior C-indices in identifying responders and progressors compared to PSA only: 0.65 vs 0.62 (p=0.028) and 0.66 vs 0.63 (p=0.044), respectively. Conclusions: PSMA-PET/CT by RECIP 1.0 is prognostic for OS and can be used as a response biomarker to monitor efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA in men with mCRPC. PSA+RECIP may be used as a novel composite endpoint in mCRPC clinical trial design.\",\n",

       "  '43Background: Deep prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined as a ≥90% decline in PSA (PSA90), is an important early prognostic factor for achieving radiographic progression free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) treated with a next generation androgen receptor inhibitor (ARI) or androgen biosynthesis inhibitor. This study compared PSA90 responses among patients with mCSPC at first use of a next generation ARI. Methods: Clinical data from 69 community urology practices in the United States were evaluated. Patients with mCSPC were classified into treatment cohorts based on their first filled prescription (index date) for apalutamide (APA) or enzalutamide (ENZ) after 12/16/2019. Patients were followed from index date until the earliest of index regimen discontinuation, treatment switch, end of clinical activity or end of data availability (03/05/2021). Included patients had ≥12 months of clinical activity to assess baseline characteristics. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to reduce baseline confounding by controlling for age, race, index year, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use ≥6 months, first-generation antiandrogen use, most recent PSA level, most recent testosterone level, Gleason score, and time between metastasis and the index date. PSA90 was defined as the earliest attainment of ≥90% decline in PSA relative to baseline PSA (most recent value within 13 weeks pre-index). The proportion of patients achieving a PSA90 and the time to PSA90 was compared using a weighted Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Results: A total of 186 APA patients and 165 ENZ patients met the study criteria. Patients’ characteristics were generally well balanced after IPTW (Table). By 6 months, 73.6% of APA and 69.5% of ENZ patients had a post index PSA measurement. At 6 months, significantly more mCSPC patients initiated on APA attained PSA90 response than patients initiated on ENZ (p=0.014; Table). This result continued to remain significant at 9 months and at the end of the follow-up (Table). The median time to PSA90 was 3.1 months for APA patients and 5.2 months for ENZ patients. Conclusions: This real-world study of mCSPC cohorts demonstrates that initiation of APA leads to significantly more patients achieving a deep PSA response more rapidly than patients initiating ENZ.

       "  '44Background: The association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and increased cardiovascular (CV) risk in prostate cancer (PCa) patients is controversial.1-2 Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurred in 3-6% of patients in a 48-week ADT trial,2 but meta-analysis from a 2011 study found no association between ADT and increased risk of CV death.1 Body mass index (BMI) is a potential risk factor; Lee et\\xa0al. found a lower risk of MACE in patients with high BMI than those with a normal weight, and patients with low BMI had a higher risk of all-cause mortality.3 This study evaluates the association between BMI and MACE risk in PCa patients on ADT using real-world data. Methods: Analyses of US electronic medical records (2010 to 2020) of PCa patients (n=36,249) receiving LHRH agonist/antagonist injections were conducted to calculate the risk of MACE since ADT initiation for the following BMI groups: <18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, 30 to <35, and >35. BMI groups were based on the standard weight status associated with each BMI range (underweight, normal or healthy weight, overweight, obese, and severely obese, respectively).4 The database contained 178,388 LHRH agonist/antagonist injection entries and 965 documented MACE events. Exclusion criteria included lack of ADT initiation date, lack of BMI data, and MACE within 6 months prior to ADT initiation. MACE was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from any cause based on a recent study in this field.2 Kaplan-Meier event-free survival curves were constructed to compare the risk of MACE between BMI groups. Statistical significance between survival curves was evaluated by log-rank test. Results: Differences in MACE incidence between BMI groups were not significant. (Table). Conclusions: MACE risk was similar across BMI subgroups after ADT initiation. This is consistent with the literature that higher BMIs do not confer additional CV/MACE risk as might be expected (a lower risk of MACE in patients with high BMI than those with normal weight).3 This 10-year analysis in >35,000 patients is likely reflective of the real world, but further study is recommended to evaluate whether BMI should be considered a predisposing risk factor for CV disease in PCa patients undergoing ADT. As the association between ADT and increased CV risk in PCa patients is controversial, future studies evaluating the role of co-morbidities on MACE risk for PCa patients during ADT may be helpful to identify other CV predictors.Patient distribution and MACE incidence post ADT initiation by BMI.BMI Group*Proportion of Patients at Baseline (%)MACE Incidence After ADT InitiationAt 1 Yr (%)At 6 Yrs (%)<18.512.21.3Insufficient data18.5 to <2523.71.04.825 to <3041.31.05.330 to <3521.91.05.7>350.80.85.9 *All pairwise comparisons are not statistically significant Nguyen PL.

       "  '45Background: Advanced hormonal therapies (abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide) and docetaxel have demonstrated an overall survival benefit when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). There are no randomized controlled trials comparing these agents, resulting in heterogeneity in first-line therapy and sequencing of therapies. Methods: We surveyed practice patterns and underlying rationale behind first-line therapy selection for mCSPC among medical and urologic oncologists at a single center (academic and community-based practices). Responses were anonymous. We evaluated associations between responses using Friedman’s test with posthoc pair-wise comparison and Fisher exact test where appropriate. Results: From 6/2021-8/2021, we received 72/77 (94%) of distributed surveys. Of the 72 providers, 39 (31 med/onc, 8 uro/onc) reported treating mCSPC. For high-volume disease, most selected ADT plus docetaxel (41%) as first-line therapy. For low-volume disease, most selected ADT plus abiraterone (31%). There continues to be the use of bicalutamide in the treatment of low-volume mCSPC (18%). When asked to rank the most important factors when considering first-line therapy, clinical symptoms (skeletal event, bone pain, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, visceral metastases) and disease volume were ranked higher than cost for both oncologists (p<0.01) and urologists (p = 0.03 for symptoms vs. cost and p<0.01 for disease volume vs. cost). When considering perceived barriers to selecting first-line therapy, 64% of providers identified out-of-pocket costs. Although uro/onc was less comfortable managing side effects of docetaxel compared to med/onc (0% vs. 100% comfortable, p<0.01), comfort levels with managing toxicities of hormonal therapies were comparable (100% vs. 97% comfortable, p=0.54). Conclusions: Given limitations of cross-trial comparison of efficacy from registration trials, the selection of front-line therapy for mCSPC often depends on shared decision-making. By this survey-based study, we observed docetaxel being favored for high-volume disease and abiraterone being favored for low-volume disease. Although cost did not factor into the selection of therapy, it was cited as the most common barrier faced by providers.

       "  '46Background: Recent literature has suggested an association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and increased cardiovascular (CV) risk in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.1,2 The 1-year incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients ≥45 years old was 1.4%,3 whereas a recent study of PCa patients on ADT reported MACE in 2.9% of patients treated with an LHRH antagonist (relugolix) and 6.2% of patients treated with an LHRH agonist (leuprolide acetate) over 48 weeks.4 Thus, MACE risk is an important consideration for PCa patients on ADT. This study aims to evaluate MACE risk after ADT initiation with LHRH agonists vs. LHRH antagonists using real-world data. Methods: Analyses of US electronic medical records (2010 to 2020) of PCa patients (n=45,059) receiving LHRH agonist and antagonist injections were conducted to evaluate the rate of MACE-free survival after ADT initiation by drug class. The database contained 178,388 LHRH agonist and antagonist injection entries and 965 documented MACE events. Exclusion criteria included taking more than one class of ADT and MACE within 6 months prior to ADT initiation. MACE was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from any cause based on a recent study in this field.4 Kaplan-Meier event-free survival curves were constructed to compare the risk of MACE between patients on agonist vs. antagonist. Statistical significance between survival curves was evaluated by log-rank test. Results: Overall MACE risk for all patients was 1.0% at one year. MACE risk was significantly higher for patients treated with LHRH antagonist compared to agonists in the first seven years after ADT initiation. Conclusions: Risk of MACE was lower than previously reported. Although this may potentially be due to underreporting, our analysis of data over 10 years from >45,000 PCa patients is likely an accurate reflection of the real world. A recent study using large real-world dataset with >50,000 PCa patients over approximately 2 years showed no difference in CV risk following treatment with GnRH agonists and antagonists.5 However, in our analyses MACE risk was lower in patients treated with LHRH agonists vs. antagonists in the first seven years after ADT initiation. Further, we plan to evaluate baseline comorbidities and demographics for imbalances. Future studies evaluating the impact of ADT class and comorbidities on MACE risk for PCa patients during ADT may be helpful to identify CV predictors. 1Ng C-F, et\\xa0al.

       "  '47Background: Practice guidelines have been modified to recommend hereditary and tumor gene mutation testing in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to identify patients for molecularly targeted therapies. Identifying appropriate candidates for testing can be challenging in electronic health records and claims data. In this study, we used natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to identify veterans with mCRPC, reported gene mutation testing rates and identified factors associated with testing. Methods: This is a retrospective observational cohort study using NLP to identify veterans diagnosed with mCRPC between 2016 and 2020. Patient and facility characteristics were reported descriptively. Chi-square and t-tests were used to determine whether differences were statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05 based on receipt of testing. Generalized linear mixed models with binomial error distributions and logit links accounting for clustering by facility were used to determine which factors were independently associated with testing. Results: 9,282 veterans were diagnosed with mCRPC between 2016 and 2020, as determined by NLP algorithms identifying diagnosis of metastatic disease and castration-resistant disease. Among these patients, 381 died within 45 days of their diagnosis, and were excluded from analysis. In the analytic cohort of 8,901 veterans, 1,282 (14%) patients received testing. Of these, 1,041 (81%) received tumor tissue testing and 292 (23%) received hereditary testing. In bivariate analyses, age, race, ethnicity, Commission on Cancer (COC) facility certification, and facility complexity rating differed between veterans who received the test versus who did not (mean age of 73 versus 77, p < 0.0001; 30% versus 24% Black, p < 0.0001; 93% versus 92% non-Hispanic, p = 0.04; 64% versus 63% COC-certified facility, p = 0.04; and 59% versus 52% most complex facility, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, older age and lower facility complexity rating were associated with lower odds of testing (for every 10-year increase in age, adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.50-0.58; Mid-high and low complexity facilities compared to highest complexity facilities: aOR, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.32-0.85 and 0.39, 0.22-0.71, respectively). Conclusions: Gene mutation testing in veterans with mCRPC is underutilized. Older age and being seen in a lower complexity facility are independently associated with a lower odds of testing. Patient and facility barriers to testing should be identified to improve guideline concordant care.',\n",

       "  '48Background: Previous reports have found that NGS testing on stage IV GU cancer patients is performed less commonly than expected based on the prevalence of GU tumors in comparison to other tumor types. In addition, most of the data on NGS testing frequency has been in the academic setting. This study will look at NGS testing in stage IV GU pts in the private practice setting. Methods: In the retrospective portion of the study, we used algorithms in Flatiron’s OncoEMR to identify baseline NGS testing frequency in all stage IV GU cancer patients. In the prospective portion, we used an EP to communicate with doctors about their stage IV GU cancer pts with upcoming appointments. Our primary endpoint was to determine the percentage of stage IV GU pts who had NGS testing; our secondary endpoint was to determine how often NGS testing would provide an alternative therapeutic option. Results: 91 stage IV GU cancer pts were identified retrospectively from 6/1/2020-12/31/2020. 20 (22%) of them had had NGS testing: 12 of 68 (18%) prostate cancer pts, 6 of 13 (46%) bladder cancer pts and 2 of 10 (20%) kidney cancer pts. Prospectively, 65 patients with Stage IV GU cancer and upcoming appointments were identified between 8/23/2021-9/13/2021. 17 (26%) had previously had NGS testing: 10 of 46 (22%) prostate pts, 4 of 9 (44%) bladder pts, and 3 of 10 (30%) kidney pts. The EP prompted additional testing of 10 pts. Of the total 27 pts, 8 (30%) were found to have actionable mutations: 7 of 17 (41%) prostate pts and 1 of 6 (17%) bladder pts. 6 of the 8 actionable mutations were either BRCA1/BRCA2 or PALB2. Conclusions: Our results supported those previously reported in academic settings which found that GU cancers were less likely than other metastatic cancers to have NGS testing performed. Prostate cancer was the least likely of the GU cancers to have NGS testing, however, the findings highlight the importance of germline testing in this population. A longer term study may have further borne out the benefits of EP. Improved communication (huddles, multidisciplinary rounds, etc.) would likely increase compliance with NGS testing as would automated order sets and “hard stops” in the EMR. As trials and standard options for GU cancers increase, physician ordering of NGS will follow. Universal NGS testing should be the goal of all stage IV GU patients to maximize therapeutic options.',\n",

       "  '49 Background: mCRPC is an incurable disease with poor prognosis. Though multiple treatments such as novel hormonal therapies (NHT: abiraterone [abi], enzalutamide [enza], docetaxel [doce], cabazitaxel [caba], sipuleucel-T [Sip-T] etc.) are approved, real-world data regarding treatment sequencing are lacking. This study assesses the real-world treatment patterns within the context of FDA-approved life-prolonging treatments for mCRPC. Methods: The IBM MarketScan database was used to identify newly diagnosed (incident) mCRPC patients from 1/1/2014-5/31/2020. Adult males were required to have a diagnosis of PC, and subsequently evidence of metastasis and castration (medical or surgical). Incident mCRPC status (index) was determined 3 ways: 1) treatment with an NHT within 3 months after castration and an FDA-approved mCRPC treatment ≥3 months after NHT; 2) first FDA-approved treatment ≥6 months after castration; 3) first FDA-approved treatment 3-6 months after castration and a second FDA-approved treatment ≥3 months after treatment. Lines of therapy (LOT) were measured in the variable-length follow-up of ≥1 month and consisted of all drugs observed within 28 days of first observed treatment. Duration of therapy was measured as start of line to start of next line or end of enrollment. Results: A total of 2,912 mCRPC patients met\\xa0all study criteria and received ≥1 LOT. Among those, 48.7% had ≥2 LOT, and 21.8% had ≥3 LOT. Patients were an average age of 71 years at index and used leuprolide (87%), abi (10%), doce (9%) and enza (8%) prior to index. In mCRPC the most common observed first line (1L) monotherapy regimens were abi (35%), enza (34%), and doce (14%). The most common observed second-line (2L) treatments were enza (36%), abi (27%), and doce (14%). Mean duration of 1L was 292 days compared to 245 days in 2L. The most frequently observed treatment sequences (1L to 2L) are reported in the table. Opioids (62%) and denosumab (47%) use was common in mCRPC patients. Conclusions: Among mCRPC patients, NHTs were the most common 1st and 2nd LOTs and alternate NHT after a first NHT was the most common sequence. With rapidly evolving treatment options in metastatic prostate cancer, these data can help guide estimation of eligible patients for different clinical trials. Further studies are needed to understand the high attrition from 1L to subsequent lines of therapy, the reasons for treatment preference and impact on clinical outcomes with different treatment sequencings.Treatment SequencesPatients with 2L1L > 2L N = 1,393Abi > Enza211 (15.1%)Enza > Abi161 (11.6%)Sip-T > Enza115 (8.3%)  ',\n",

       "  '50Background: Studies have suggested that statin use is associated with prostate cancer mortality. However, uncertainties exist in how the solubility profile of statins impact cancer outcomes. Lipophilic statins have greater accessibility in extrahepatic tissues, which may lead to stronger inhibitory effects on cancer cells, whereas hydrophilic statins exhibit greater hepato-selectivity and therefore less likely to cause drug interactions and adverse events. Abiraterone (ABI) and enzalutamide (ENZ) are antiandrogen agents used in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this study, we sought to examine whether statin usage and lipophilicity of statins is associated with survival benefits in mCRPC patients receiving ABI or ENZ. Methods: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study of the Veteran Affairs population. Patients with mCRPC who received statin therapy one year prior to initiation of either ABI or ENZ between 9/10/2014 and 6/3/2017 were included and followed until April 2020. Statins were categorized as lipophilic (atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin, pitavastatin) and hydrophilic (rosuvastatin and pravastatin). A cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of overall survival after controlling for known prognostic factors including age, Charlson-Romano Comorbidity Index, use of bone-modifying agents, Body-Mass Index, and prostate specific antigen levels. Results: A total of 4919 patients (mean age 75.0 years) were included in our cohort. Of those, 969 patients (19.7%) received lipophilic statins and 452 patients (9.2%) received hydrophilic statins. After adjusting for known factors, statin use was not associated with improved overall survival (aHR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 – 1.00). Similarly, the use of lipophilic statins (aHR 0.98; 95% CI 0.90 – 1.06) or hydrophilic statins (aHR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 – 1.01) were not associated with improved overall survival in mCRPC. Conclusions: Our study found no differences in overall survival between mCRPC patients with statin use compared to those without statins. When analyzing statin lipophilicity, we saw a higher trend towards survival in the hydrophilic statin group compared to the lipophilic statin group, which contradicts the direct anticancer benefits of lipophilic statins, but neither group reached statistical significance. Further studies analyzing statin usage and types with specific outcome measures such as cardiovascular events, duration of antiandrogen therapy, and adverse events related to ABI or ENZ will support in optimal therapy choices for mCRPC.',\n",

       "  '51Background: The U. S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation regarding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transitioned to a grade D recommendation against PSA screening for adult males in 2012. The impact of this recommendation against PSA screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in contemporary cohorts is unknown. Our study evaluated PCSM between 1999-2019, comparing mortality rates before and after this change to screening guidelines. Methods: Age-adjusted PCSM rates per 100,000 men were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1999 – 2019. Trends in PCSM rates from 1999 – 2012 and 2014 – 2019 were estimated using linear regression with year and binary indicator of pre-2013/post-2013 status as interaction terms. Age-adjusted rates of PCSM were calculated for men ≥50 years and by race, ethnicity, urbanization and census region. Similarly, age-adjusted rates of overall cancer mortality (exclusive of PCSM) were calculated. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System was used to establish trends in PSA screening from 2001 – 2018. North American Association of Central Cancer Registries was used to determine age-adjusted incidence of localized and metastatic PC at the time of diagnosis from 1999 – 2017. Results: The age-adjusted PCSM rate in the U.S. decreased linearly at a rate of (-)0.28 per 100,000/year from 1999 – 2012 and subsequently stalled at a rate of no change from 2014 – 2019 (p < 0.001). This effect was particularly striking for men aged 60 – 69, men > 80 years, and Black men. Men aged 60 – 64 had a decreasing rate of (-)0.009 per 100,000/year prior to 2013, followed by a rise of (+)0.001 per 100,000/year (p < 0.001). Among Black men, PCSM rate was decreasing linearly at (-)0.700/100,000/year from 1999-2012 and flattened at a rate of (-)0.091/100,000/year from 2014-2019 (p < 0.001). These changes were seen across races, urbanization and census regions (p < 0.001) and were accompanied by decreases in PSA screening (p = 0.02) together with increases in diagnosis of metastatic disease. These trends were inconsistent with mortality trends observed across all malignancies. Conclusions: Using comprehensive data on PCSM through 2019, this study illustrates decreasing PCSM over time which flattened or increased following the 2012 change in USPSTF guideline, along with a decrease in PSA screening. The change in PCSM was seen in all ages, races, ethnicities, urbanization and census regions, but particularly in men from 60 – 69 and > 80 years old, and Black men. These changes were accompanied by increased diagnosis of metastatic PC and are discordant from trends across other malignancies. These findings suggest that the change in PSA screening guideline may have contributed to the stagnancy of PCSM rates in recent years. The updated 2018 USPSTF guideline supporting shared-decision making may reverse these trends over time.',\n",

       "  '52Background: Novel hormonal therapies (NHTs) and docetaxel were initially approved for the tx of men with mCRPC. Over time, these agents moved earlier in the disease continuum and are now also used in metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). Little is known about first-line (1L) mCRPC tx patterns for men with prior taxane-based chemotherapy (CT) or NHT exposure. This study evaluated the impact of taxane CT or NHT use in mCSPC on recent 1L tx patterns among men with mCRPC in the US. Methods: Participating physicians collected information from medical charts for the next consecutive 4 adult men with mCRPC during January-August 2020. A subset of men had prior mCSPC tx information available. 1L mCRPC txs were described overall and stratified by previous tx with taxane CT or NHT during mCSPC. No statistical comparisons were performed. Results: 116 adult men with mCRPC and known mCSPC tx history were included. Mean age was 70 years; 15% had known family history of prostate cancer; 70% had bone metastases and 33% had visceral metastases at data collection. Overall, 10% (12/116) of men had been previously treated with taxane CT and 28% (32/116) were treated with NHT during mCSPC. 1L mCRPC tx was initiated on average 35 days after mCRPC diagnosis. NHT was the most common 1L mCRPC tx regardless of prior taxane CT or NHT use. Men pre-treated with taxane CT were more likely to initiate mCRPC tx with NHT than taxane naïve men. NHT pre-treated men were less likely to initiate 1L mCRPC tx with NHT and more likely to initiate tx with docetaxel than NHT naïve men. 53% of men with prior NHT tx were rechallenged with NHTs in 1L mCRPC. (Table). Conclusions: Findings from this US real-world study among men with mCRPC suggest physicians most commonly initiate 1L mCRPC life-prolonging tx with NHT regardless of prior taxane CT or NHT exposure. Additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and better understand optimal tx sequencing, especially as new tx options become available.1L mCRPC txs stratified by mCSPC tx among men with mCRPC.1L mCRPC tx, n (%)All mCRPC men with mCSPC tx historyn=116Pre-treated with taxanen=12Taxane naïven=104Pre-treated with NHTn=32NHT naïven=84Taxane naïve and NHT naïven=72Life-prolonging mCRPC therapy104 (90)10 (83)94 (90)25 (78)79 (94)69 (96)NHT87 (75)10 (83)77 (74)17 (53)70 (83)60 (83)Abiraterone33 (28)5 (42)28 (27)11 (34)22 (26)17 (24)Enzalutamide51 (44)5 (42)46 (44)4 (13)47 (56)42 (58)Apalutamide3 (3)0 (0)3 (3)2 (6)1 (1)1 (1)Docetaxel10 (9)0 (0)10 (10)5 (16)5 (6)5 (7)Othera7 (6)0 (0)7 (7)3 (9)4 (5)4 (6)No life-prolonging therapyb12 (10)2 (17)10 (10)7 (22)5 (6)3 (4) aOther includes sipuleucel-T, radium-223 and chemotherapy combinations bAndrogen deprivation therapy ± 1st generation anti-androgen',\n",

       "  '53Background: To describe patterns of practice of PSA testing and imaging for Ontario men receiving continuous androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Methods: This was a retrospective, longitudinal, population-based study of administrative health data from 2008 to 2019. Men > 65 years old receiving continuous ADT with documented CRPC were included. An administrative proxy definition was applied to capture patients with nmCRPC patients and excluded those with metastatic disease. Patients were indexed upon progression to CRPC and were followed until death or end of study period to assess frequency of monitoring with PSA tests and conventional imaging. A 2-year look-back window was used to assess patterns of care leading up to CRPC, as well as baseline covariates. Results: At a median follow-up of 40 months, 944 patients with CRPC were identified. Their median time from initiation of ADT to CRPC was 26 months, 61% of patients had their PSA measured twice or fewer in the year prior to index and 71% patients did not receive any imaging in the year following progression to CRPC. Almost all patients (98%, n = 921/944) in the study progressed to high-risk CRPC (HR-CRPC) during the study period, of which more than half received fewer than 3 PSA tests in the year prior to progression to HR-CRPC, and 31% received no imaging in the subsequent year. Conclusions: PSA testing and imaging studies are under-utilized in a real-world setting for the management of nmCRPC, including those at high-risk of developing metastatic disease. Infrequent monitoring impedes proper risk stratification, disease staging, detection of treatment failure and/or metastases, likely delaying necessary treatment intensification with life-prolonging therapies. Adherence to guideline recommendations and the importance of timely staging should be reinforced to optimize patients’ outcome.',\n",

       "  '54Background: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers in men. When making treatment decisions, patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and caregiver need are important considerations, and as such it is imperative to understand the impact that PC has on HRQoL. We aimed to assess the impact of metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (mHSPC) and castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) on HRQoL and associated caregiver need. Methods: Real-world data were drawn from the PC Disease Specific Programme, a point-in-time survey conducted in the United States of America and Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) between Jan-Aug 2020. Physicians completed patient record forms for their next 8 consecutively consulting adult metastatic PC patients (4 mHSPC/4 mCRPC). Eligible patients were invited to complete a voluntary patient self-reported form on caregiver need and HRQoL including EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L), EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General/Prostate (FACT-G/P) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL and more pain. Data were analysed descriptively. Results: 376 mHSPC and 331 mCRPC patients completed patient self-reported forms. Demographics and clinical characteristics for mHSPC/mCRPC patients were: mean age 71.1/71.5 years, 77%/69% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1, 82%/83% of patients were retired and 42%/44% of patients had a caregiver. At data collection, mean HRQoL scores for mHSPC/mCRPC patients were: 66.4/63.4 (EQ-VAS), 0.76/0.72 (EQ-5D-5L), 66.2/62.9 (FACT-G) and 94.6/90.2 (FACT-P). Patients with mHSPC had FACT-P social, emotional, functional and physical well-being subscale scores of 18.2, 14.7, 13.6 and 19.7, respectively. These scores were 17.7, 14.0, 12.7 and 18.5 in mCRPC patients, respectively. Mean “worst pain” scores were mild (3.6/3.9 on BPI for mHSPC/mCRPC patients). In terms of both non-professional and professional caregivers, mHSPC/mCRPC patients reported a mean of 31.6/28.9 care hours/week. Most caregivers were partners/spouses (in 89% of mHSPC and 82% of mCRPC patients) providing a mean of 29.0 and 27.7 care hours/week, respectively. Conclusions: We showed that HRQoL and well-being are impacted in both mHSPC and mCRPC patients, and that there is a considerable time burden on caregivers. Patients with mCRPC reported the lowest HRQoL scores and highest pain scores, suggesting that patients who are sicker may have greater disease burden. Our findings suggest an unmet need for HRQoL in patients with mHSPC and mCRPC, and also a need for greater caregiver support in these patients.',\n",

       "  '55Background: Bone modifying agents (BMAs) prevent skeletal related events (SREs) among patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) involving the bone. The utilization of BMAs among patients with mCRPC and bone metastasis has not been well defined, and the number of patients who may benefit but are undertreated is not known. We conducted this study to measure patterns of BMA among mCRPC patients. Methods: We used linked SEER cancer registry and Medicare claims data. Our cohort included men newly diagnosed with de-novo stage IV prostate adenocarcinoma during 2007-2015, with followup through 2016. We included those age > = 66 at diagnosis, had continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B from 180 days prior to diagnosis through the outcome period and Part D from diagnosis through outcome period, and who received androgen deprivation therapy. We further limited the cohort to those who subsequently received a CRPC-defining therapy (eg., abiraterone, sipuleucel-T, docetaxel if occurring prior to CHAARTED trial results). We grouped the cohort according to those who did vs. did not have evidence of bone metastasis in claims. Our primary outcome was receipt of a BMA (zoledronic acid or denosumab) within 180 days of initiating a CRPC-defining therapy. Among patients who received BMAs after initiating CRPC therapy, we further characterized the time at which they first initiated a BMA. Results: Our sample included 1,303 patients, of which 85% had evidence of bone metastasis. Overall, 58% received a BMA within 180 days of initiating a CRPC-defining therapy. 66% of patients with evidence of bone metastasis received BMAs, compared to 16% of those without evidence. Of patients who received BMAs, 38% first received BMAs between 90 days prior to starting CRPC therapy and 180 days after; the remaining 62% were previously receiving BMAs during the castrate-sensitive phase of disease. Among patients with evidence of bone metastasis who initiated CRPC-defining therapy in 2007-2009, 65% received BMAs; this proportion was 69% and 64% for those began CRPC therapy during 2010-2013 and 2014-2016, respectively. Conclusions: Approximately two-thirds of patients with mCRPC and bone metastases received BMAs within 180 days of initiating a CRPC-defining therapy. In most cases BMA therapy was initiated while patients still had castrate-sensitive disease, for which BMAs are indicated only at lower doses for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Further work is needed to understand whether real-world dosing is in line with clinical indications, and whether the one-third of patients who did not receive BMA therapy appropriately reflects the proportion of patients with contraindications. Further work is also needed to characterize patient and provider factors associated with appropriate BMA use.',\n",

       "  '56Background: Mental illness is a growing issue in the USA. More individuals continue to be diagnosed with illnesses such as depression and anxiety and placed on necessary medications. Studies have shown that the psychological makeup of an individual greatly impacts their health behavior and usage of preventative measures. However, there is limited research on the effect of anxiety and depression on PSA testing. This study explores the associations between the use of anxiety and depression medications and PSA testing. Methods: We used data from the National Health Interview Survey during the year 2018, and assessed responses to the question “Have you ever had a PSA test?” and “What is the number of PSA tests you had in the last 5 years?”. Responses were stratified by whether men were taking medications for anxiety, depression, both or none. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to define adjusted odds ratios of undergoing PSA testing adjusting for relevant socio-economic and demographic parameters. Results: Among the 5,035 male participants, 89.4% did not take any medication, 2.9% reported they took anxiety medication, 2.1% took depression medication and 5.5% took both medications. There was a significantly higher rate of PSA testing in men who took medications for both anxiety and depression compared to men taking no medications (p=0.002). Furthermore, the average number of PSA tests in the last 5 years was highest in the group of men taking both medications (p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis showed that men who took medications for both depression and anxiety were more likely to undergo PSA testing in comparison to men, not on any of these medications (OR=1.755, p=0.001). The multivariable analysis also showed that age, living with a spouse, and prior cancer history were associated with an increased likelihood of PSA testing while being a minority, living in the south of the USA, and being a current smoker was associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing PSA testing. Conclusions: Taking both anxiety and depression medications in men may be associated with a higher likelihood of undergoing PSA testing. Despite obvious limitations of this analysis including its retrospective nature and recall bias, this association needs to be further explored, especially due to rising use of these medication in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic.Multivariable model assessing associations with ever having a PSA blood test.95% confidence intervalP ValueOdds RatioLowerUpperSexual Orientation (Heterosexual reference)Gay.0171.8301.1162.999Bisexual.3141.819.5675.832Other/Unknown.624.867.4881.538Taking medications for anxiety or depression (None reference)For anxiety only0.2751.252.8361.876For depression only0.1661.436.8612.395For both0.0011.7551.2732.421[1] [1] The results were also adjusted for Age, Marital status, Race, Working status, Region, Smoking status, and History of Cancer.',\n",

Relugolix (Rel) was given FDA approval for use in prostate cancer (PCa) based on the phase 3 HERO trial but some real-world concerns include compliance, affordability, and performance in patients transitioning from another GnRH agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents. The aim of our study was to evaluate the real-world implications of prescribing and/or switching to Rel. Methods: A single institution retrospective study was conducted on patients prescribed Rel. Treatment data including concomitant therapeutic agents were collected. Compliance data was measured via chart review and pharmacy dispensary records. Patients were classified as either newly castrated or transitioning from another agent. PSA and testosterone levels were tabulated. Reported adverse effects (AE), and reasons for discontinuation if applicable including financial toxicity were noted. Results: 50 patients were reviewed; 15 (30%) treated for adjuvant, 18 (36%) for biochemical recurrence, and 17 (34%) for metastatic PCa. 12% were on concomitant therapy with abiraterone, 4% with enzalutamide, and 2% with apalutamide. 80% reported compliance to Rel. 5 (10%) never filled the prescription. 30 (60%) were newly castrated (castration restart or naïve) while 16 (36%) were transitioned from another GnRH. No changes in PSA or testosterone were noted in patients switched form injected GnRH to Rel. The most common documented AE effects included hot flashes 24%, fatigue, 29%, and weight gain 9%. No unexpected toxicity was reported in combination with abiraterone. Of 11 patients who discontinued therapy, 45% did so due to cost, 36% due to AE, and 27% due to therapy completion. 4 of 16 (25%) of those who transitioned from injection GnRH felt symptoms were worse on Rel. Conclusions: In our early experience with Rel, patients did comply to therapy based on self-reporting, pharmacy fill dates, and laboratory evidence of castration. However, financial toxicity was and remains a significant barrier both accessing Rel and remaining on Rel therapy. While a differential toxicity was reported by those who switched from injection GnRH, sometimes leading to discontinuation, there were no new safety signals reported, especially in combination with abiraterone.

       "  '58Background: Comprehensive care for PCa patients extends well beyond selecting therapies based on available guidelines. Patients should be supported to understand the disease, diagnostics, optimal treatment strategies, side-effects, avert morbidity and improve diet and exercise while combating stress. We present data supporting that patient participation in a video peer-led support group is integral to attaining these goals. Face-to-face peer groups are not readily accessible to many patients. AnCan has hosted virtual meeting support groups across the spectrum of malignancies and stages since 2010. We offer navigation, advocacy, and educational webinars. PCa is our cornerstone, including groups focusing on active surveillance/ high risk/recurrent/advanced disease, as well as under-60 patients. Methods: During spring 2021, a survey questionnaire focused on all disease stages was sent to 1174 men in the AnCan database; a second survey focused on active surveillance was send to 1200 active surveillance patients in the AnCan, Active Surveillance Patients International and Prostate Cancer International databases. We evaluated patient experience and how information acquired informed their treatment, interactions with their medical team, lifestyle, stress, and quality of life (QoL). Results: 238 responses were received for the AnCan survey, and 165 for the active aurveillance Survey, totaling. 389 independent responses. 228 (33%) were on Active Surveillance for low risk, and 93 (23%) had advanced PCa, largely distributed across North America. 154 (40%) repeatedly attend AnCan meetings. All (100%) indicated that meetings helped understand disease, navigate their treatment options, improve interaction with their medical teams and improve their quality of life (QoL). In the AnCan Suvey, 48 (19%) patients opted to move to different care teams and 32 (13 %) of those elected PCa specialists. 138 (58%) improved exercise, 90 (38%) improved diet, and 119 (50% ) reported stress reduction. 202 patients (85%) felt the groups to be welcoming, 102 (43%) connected with others, and 70 (30%) developed friendships. Of those who attend Active Surveillance meetings, 75 (68%) said that attendance helped them be their own best advocate, while 25 (23%) said that attendance informed them of new insights and treatments. Conclusions: The AnCan Support Group model increases patient knowledge, positively impacts treatment planning, and promotes lifestyle improvements while providing support to reduce stress, boosts confidence in navigating the disease, and improves QoL. AnCan empower patients to self-advocate and improve their disease experience. This is integral to optimize physician/patient interactions and improve outcomes. We advocate that virtual peer group attendance, based on our model, be included in NCCN treatment recommendations for PCa patients, especially with advanced disease.',\n",

       "  '59Background: Guidelines recommend germline genetic not only for men with advanced and metastatic prostate cancer but also those with NCCN-high risk disease. Many men harboring germline DNA repair defects would not have met criteria for testing under previous guidelines (Nicolosi et\\xa0al, JAMA Oncol 2019). Knowledge of germline mutations is pertinent due to recent regulatory approval of PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib and guides screening for first-degree relatives who are at increased risk for other cancers (Pritchard et\\xa0al, NEJM 2016). Knowledge gaps for germline genetic testing have been previously described (Loeb et\\xa0al, Cancer Treat Res Commun 2020). Through a series of educational sessions, we sought to increase utilization of appropriate genetic services for men with prostate cancer. Methods: Starting March 2021, virtual educational presentations were held for nurse navigators, urologists, and medical oncologists throughout our large community-based healthcare system. Surveys were distributed following each presentation to measure clinicians’ perception of their knowledge regarding prostate cancer genetics referrals on a five-step scale. Prostate cancer patient referral data was measured from September 2020 to August 2021, six months prior to and after the presentations. Results: Self-reported understanding of prostate cancer genetics referral practices following the educational presentations increased by an average of 1.7/5 steps (2.5 to 4.2/5) for physicians and 1.4/5 steps (2.9 to 4.1/5) for nurse navigators. From March to August 2021, there were 107 genetic referrals for prostate cancer (average 17.8 referrals/month) compared to 49 referrals from September 2020 to February 2021 (8.2 referrals/month). Conclusions: Prostate cancer genetics referrals increased 118% following educational presentations to urologists, medical oncologists, and nurse navigators. This correlates with an improvement in self-reported knowledge gaps. Provider education interventions may improve access to genetic services for men with prostate cancer. The increase in referrals likely does not account for all patients meeting criteria for germline testing. Work is ongoing to calculate the number of referrals as a proportion of the eligible population.Pre-EducationPost-EducationReferrals/month8.217.8Physician self-reported knowledge of appropriate testing (Scale 1-5)2.54.2Nurse Navigator self-reported knowledge of appropriate testing (Scale 1-5)2.94.1 ',\n",

       "  '60Background: Combined ADT and ARPI is associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared with ADT alone in patients with mCSPC. The activity of subsequent therapies for mCRPC is not well characterized. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled on a biobank at 6 cancer centres in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who received abiraterone or apalutamide for mCSPC were included. Data including baseline clinical prognostic factors and clinical outcomes (per Prostate Cancer Working Group III) were collected from patient records. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Log Rank test and prognostic variables were determined using Cox regression. Results: 168 patients were identified of which 126 (75%) received abiraterone, 38 (23%) received apalutamide, and 4 (2%) received one ARPI and switched to the other for toxicity. Median age was 69 years and Gleason score ≥ 8 in 61%. Site of metastasis (mets) at mCSPC was lymph node (n=91), bone (n=141), and liver (n=6). As of August 28 2021, a total of 46 patients progressed to mCRPC, of which 38 received subsequent systemic therapy. First-line mCRPC treatments were docetaxel (n=12), Radium-223 (10), enzalutamide (6), platinum chemotherapy (3), and others (7) including immune checkpoint inhibitors (1) and Lutetium177-PSMA-617 (1) and other investigational agents (5). Outcomes are shown in the table. On univariate Cox analysis, clinical factors at time of mCRPC associated with worse OS were: LDH above upper limit of normal (HR 5.0, 95% CI 1.7-14.5), hemoglobin below lower limit of normal (5.2, 1.1-23.8), presence of ≥ 20 bone mets (3.7, 1.4-9.8), and increasing PSA (1.002, 1.001-1.003). Conclusions: PSA decline rates and survival are modest for patients who have progressed following upfront abiraterone or apalutamide plus ADT for mCSPC. Further follow-up is required to accurately determine outcomes with current mCRPC standard therapies following up-front ADT+ ARPI. Recently approved treatment options such as Lutetium177-PSMA-617 and PARP inhibitors for DNA damage repair deficient tumors may help to improve outcomes for these patients.AllDocetaxelEnzalutamideRa223PSA50 decline25%27%33%11%Median time to PSA progression† (months)4.9 (95% CI 3.8-6.0)3.4 (3.1-3.7)3.0 (2.4-3.6)6.5 (4.3-8.7)Median overall survival from therapy onset (months)9.7 (95% CI 4.6-14.8)12.7 (2.4-23.0)9.7 (1.4-18.0)15.2 (0.7-29.7) ',\n",

       "  '61Background: Little is known on modalities of use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in real life. They may depend on tumor aggressiveness, patient frailty and physician habits. Our purpose was to describe reasons of choice of planned total duration of triptorelin treatment, mainly according to circumstances of prescription. Methods: Initiated in November 2020, a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study is conducted in France (TALISMAN). Urologists, radiation oncologists and medical oncologists recruited patients with histologically confirmed PCa, eligible for triptorelin therapy within its label, with a planned total duration of at least 12 months. Decision of triptorelin treatment was made before inclusion, in routine practice. 786 patients were planned to be enrolled, with a 12-month follow-up. Primary objective is to describe the proportion of patients treated continuously with triptorelin during the 12 months following treatment initiation. Interim analysis was planned when 50% of patients are enrolled, its objective was description of subgroups according to circumstance of prescription, planned total duration of triptorelin treatment, formulation/route of triptorelin prescribed, specialty of investigators. No statistical test was performed. Results: 509 patients were included in the interim analysis. Patients were mostly enrolled by urologists (56.8%) and radiation oncologists (40.1%). Mean age ±SD was 73.9±8.0 years; 70.9% had at least one comorbidity; 72.1% had a Gleason score ≥ 4+3; 65.2% had at least one concomitant PCa treatment. Main baseline parameters are presented in Table. Subgroups description showed that patients with high risk localized and patients with locally advanced PCa were most often offered a [24-36] month planned treatment duration (respectively 53.6% and 40.6%), in accordance with the guidelines. Reasons of choice of the planned total duration mainly refer to Gleason score (27.6%) and PSA level (19.4%). Reasons of choice of formulation/route of triptorelin prescribed mainly refer to physician preferred formulation/route (47.7%) and planned total duration of ADT (29.9%). Conclusions: The ongoing TALISMAN study is collecting data on patients, PCa aggressiveness, supportive care, which may impact total duration of triptorelin treatment.

       "  '62Background: The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), has increased over time in the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). ATD is accompanied by side effects, some of which may increase the cardiovascular (CV) risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular risks and quality of life at the initiation of degarelix, a GnRH antagonist, and 6 months later, in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive PCa. Methods: The DUO study is a PASS, pharmaco-epidemiologic, longitudinal, multicenter observational study. It prospectively enrolled PCa patients during the first 6 months of treatment with degarelix. cohort to describe the prevalence of real-life cardiovascular co-morbidities in. The study was carried out in 46 French urology centers. At D0 and M6, the prevalence of CV, osteoporotic, metabolic, mood disorder, geriatric and sexual morbidity and risk factors were recorded using validated tools and questionnaires. EQ-5D questionnaire measured quality of life. The evolution of the disease (PSA levels) and the tolerance of the treatments were also reported. Results: A total of 124 patients with advanced hormone-dependent PCa (of whom 26.6% were metastatic) were included. At D0 57.7% of patients had a CV morbidity and CV risk factors. Metabolic co-morbidities were also present in 60.6% of patients, osteoporotic risk factors in 34%, sexual disorders in 58%, and mood disorders in 36%. ONCO-G8 score ≤ 14 was observed in 45.6% of patients aged ≥ 70 years. The percentage of patients with CV co-morbidities remained stable (56.7%). The rates of osteoporotic, metabolic, sexual, and mood-related morbidity and risk factors also remained unaltered. Likewise, quality of life remained stable between D0 and M6 (Scores: 0.765 and 0.813 respectively). At the same time, the median PSA rate decreased by -98.4% from D0 (p < 0.001). 42 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 22 patients: degarelix-related AEs were reported in 4.4% of patients. Conclusions: The results of the DUO study showed high prevalence of CV co-morbidity and risk factors in patients with advanced PCa. It also showed no significant increase in CV co-morbidities and risk-factors during the first 6 months of treatment with degarelix as it was observed for osteoporotic, metabolic, sexual, and mood-related disorders. The GnRH antagonist was well tolerated without major impact on quality of life. Assessment of multiple co-morbidities at the initiation and during ADT is mandatory for the optimal management of patients.',\n",

       "  '63 Background: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a lethal disease with significant morbidity. Poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are targeted therapeutics approved to treat mCRPC patients with genetic mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR). However, to benefit from PARPi as a single agent, patients usually need to undergo biomarker testing to determine their mutation status. As an initial step to understand patient preferences for mCRPC treatments, this study investigated the treatment features important to mCRPC patients and their preferences for and perceptions of biomarker testing. Methods: This preliminary qualitative study included 25 men in the US, UK, Germany, Spain, and Japan with self-reported mCRPC diagnosed at least 6 months previously. Participants completed a 60-minute one-on-one interview about mCRPC treatments and disease impact.  Results: Participants had a mean age of 62 years and were diagnosed with prostate cancer an average of 68 months prior. About half (52%) had metastasized > 1 year prior and more than half (56%) reported no HRR genetic mutation. The most frequently reported symptoms were pain (60%), urinary problems (56%), and fatigue (32%). Participants stated that pain impacted their sleep, daily activities, and social lives. 60% reported they shared treatment decision-making with their physician, some (24%) shared it with partners or caregivers, and others (32%) left treatment decisions up to their physician due to their lack of knowledge. Quality of life (QoL) was the most important treatment benefit reported (56%), followed by progression-free survival (PFS) (52%), overall survival (OS) (48%), and reduced pain (44%). Some participants reported their desire for prolonged survival needed to be balanced with adequate QoL. Few participants reported reduced fatigue (24%) or urinary problems (12%) as desired treatment benefits. 64% had previously undergone biomarker testing to determine mutation status. 56% of tested participants reported that their physician discussed the purpose and benefits of testing. Based on conversations with their physicians, both tested and untested participants felt that biomarker testing would inform them about heritable risk of mutation and help find new targeted treatments. Untested participants with a negative view of biomarker testing (22%) reported concerns about the need for further invasive biopsies. Conclusions: QoL followed by PFS, OS, and reduced pain were the most important benefits of treatment to participants. More than half of participants had a positive view of biomarker testing, especially if testing could lead to targeted therapies and inform about heritable risk. These results will inform the design of an international discrete choice study of biomarker testing among men with mCRPC. ',\n",

       "  '64Background: Routine clinical data from the electronic medical record are indispensable for retrospective and prospective observational studies and clinical trials. Their reproducibility is often not assessed. We sought to develop a prostate cancer-specific database with a defined source hierarchy for clinical annotations and to evaluate data reproducibility. Methods: At a comprehensive cancer center, we designed and implemented a clinical database for men with prostate cancer and clinical-grade paired tumor–normal sequencing for whom we performed team-based retrospective clinical data annotation from the electronic medical record, using a prostate cancer-specific data dictionary. We developed an open-source R package for data processing. We then evaluated completeness of data elements, reproducibility of team-based annotation using blinded repeat annotation by a medical oncologist as the reference, and the impact of measurement error on bias in survival analyses. Results: Data elements on demographics, diagnosis and staging, disease state at the time of procuring a genomically characterized sample, and clinical outcomes were piloted and then abstracted for 2,261 patients and their 2,631 genomically profiled samples. Completeness of data elements was generally high, between 55% to 99% for elements of clinical TNM staging, self-reported race, biopsy Gleason score, and presence of variant histologies, both for the team-based annotation and the repeat annotation. Comparing team-based annotation to the repeat annotation (100 patients/samples), reproducibility of annotations was high to very high. For 7 binary data elements, both sensitivity and specificity of the team-based annotation reached or exceeded 90%. The T stage, metastasis date, and presence and date of castration resistance had lower reproducibility. Impact of measurement error on estimates for strong prognostic factors was modest. Conclusions: With a prostate cancer-specific data dictionary and quality control measures, manual team-based annotations can be scalable and reproducible. The data dictionary and the R package for reproducible data processing tools provided (https://stopsack.github.io/prostateredcap) are freely available to help increase data quality in clinical prostate cancer research.',\n",

       "  '65Background: The natural history of non-metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) prior to the introduction of novel anti-androgen agents in a real-world setting is largely unknown. Methods: This was a retrospective population-based cohort study of men with nmCRPC in Ontario, Canada. Patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, castrate level of testosterone ( < 1.7nmol/L) and a PSA > 2.0nmol/L with a subsequent rise > 25% from the nadir, and without diagnostic or treatment codes for metastasis were included. Annual prevalence of nmCRPC was calculated. Crude time from nmCRPC to metastasis and death are presented as medians with interquartile range (IQR). Predictors of time from nmCRPC to prostate cancer death were compared using univariable and multivariable Fine and Gray subdistributional hazard models to account for the competing risk of non-prostate cancer death. Results: From January 2007 until March 2018, we identified 2045 patients with nmCRPC. Median age was 79 years (IQR: 72-84). A total of 984 patients (48.1%) received upfront hormonal therapy while 584 (25.8%) received initial radiotherapy (RT) and 478 (23.4%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Median time from primary treatment to nmCRPC was 6 years (IQR: 3-10). PSA at the time of meeting nmCRPC criteria was a median of 3.0 ng/L. Patients were followed for a median 31.1 months (IQR: 19.8-47.9). The overall annual prevalence of nmCRPC ranged from 1,519-1,913 patients, representing 7-12% of men with prostate cancer prescribed androgen deprivation therapy each year. Crude median time from nmCRPC to all-cause death was 37.6 months (IQR: 22.1-55.4). Median time from nmCRPC to metastasis and metastasis to all-cause death was 20.0 and 8.3 months, respectively. On regression analysis, older age, ADT use with primary treatment, higher PSA at the time of meeting nmCRPC criteria, and grade group predicted time from nmCRPC to prostate cancer death. Conclusions: This is the largest analysis of the prevalence and natural history of nmCRPC. The current study can be used as a historical cohort to compare how novel imaging modalities and advancements in systemic therapy for patients with nmCRPC impact prevalence estimates and disease trajectory over time.',\n",

       "  '66Background: Novel hormonal therapies (NHTs) and taxane-based chemotherapy (CT) were initially approved for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and are now approved for use in mCSPC. Little is known about the recent uptake of these treatments in mCSPC. This study evaluated mCSPC treatment trends from 2016 to 2020 in the US. Methods: Participating physicians collected information from medical charts for the next consecutive 8 men with advanced prostate cancer (4 men with mCSPC, and 4 men with mCRPC) during January-August 2020. A subset of men with current mCRPC had historical mCSPC treatment information available. Treatments were categorized into 4 mutually exclusive categories: (1) androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ± first-generation anti-androgen (1st gen AA); treatment intensification with (2) NHT, (3) taxane CT ± NHT, and (4) other treatments (e.g., radium-223, sipuleucel-T, non-taxane CT). To account for the availability of new mCSPC treatments, treatment patterns across all lines of mCSPC therapy were described for men initiating treatment in 2016-2018 and 2019-2020. Results: 239 men with mCSPC were included (146 with mCSPC at data collection; 93 with mCRPC at data collection and who had historical information on mCSPC treatments). Mean age was 69 years; 69% had bone metastases and 30% had visceral metastases. Most patients were managed by oncologists (75%), while 48% were treated at academic/cancer centers. From 2016-2018 to 2019-2020, mCSPC treatment intensification with NHT increased while treatment intensification with taxane CT or other therapies declined. (Table) Conclusions: In this real-world study of adult men with mCSPC, increased use of NHT was observed over time indicating that more men will have been exposed to NHT when they progress to mCRPC. This suggests an unmet need for novel therapies in mCRPC. Funding: Pfizer.

       "  '67Background: Several therapies for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have become available since 2010 with the hope of prolonging survival for those at the end stages of their disease. Little is known about the survival of men who receive novel therapies in the real world and the disease burden of patients initiating treatment for CRPC between 2010 and 2017. Methods: Using the Veterans Health Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified Veterans with CRPC who received first-line therapy for castration-resistant disease between 2010-2017. Therapies included ketoconazole, docetaxel, abiraterone, and enzalutamide since > 99% of patients treated for CRPC received one of these therapies first-line for CRPC. We used a Cox model to calculate the overall survival of patients from time of first CRPC treatment for each year. We then adjusted for patient and disease characteristics, such as starting PSA level, and prognostic group at the start of treatment based on hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels. Results: In a cohort of 4,998 men started on treatment for CRPC between 2010-2017, survival from start of first-line treatment gradually increased between 2010-2017. In 2010, when 38% of men received docetaxel first-line and 62% ketoconazole, the probability of surviving at least one year from start of first-line therapy was 64%. In 2017, when the landscape of first-line treatment had changed (49% abiraterone, 9% docetaxel, 41% enzalutamide, 1% ketoconazole) one-year survival from start of first therapy improved to 72%. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for an additional calendar year was 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.95). Men started on first-line CRPC therapy in 2010 had worse prognostic labs at the start of therapy, suggesting worse disease, and had a higher PSA value at the start of therapy compared to those started on CRPC therapy in 2017 (median PSA 55.1 in 2010 vs 27.8 in 2017, p-value < 0.01). When adjusting for disease characteristics, the improvement in survival we saw between 2010 and 2017 was diminished with adjusted HR for an additional calendar year of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00). Conclusions: With the development of novel therapies, the survival of patients with similar disease burden should gradually improve over time. Although we did see a modest improvement in survival between 2010-2017, this improvement was mitigated when adjusting for disease severity, suggesting that some of the improvement in survival may be affected by a lead-time bias—treating patients earlier in their CRPC.',\n",

       "  '68Background: Germline genetic testing criteria for individuals with prostate cancer (PCa) are expanding. Alternative genetic service models are needed to meet increased need for genetic testing. Studies have shown no difference in genetic testing uptake, satisfaction, or knowledge when patients undergo face-to-face genetic counseling compared to pre-test video genetic education (VGE). Data is limited comparing options for how video genetic education is delivered. This study evaluated the impact of pre-test VGE when facilitated by a genetic counseling assistant (assistant-led) or self-completed by the patient (patient-led). Methods: Individuals with PCa referred for genetic counseling received pre-test VGE. Patients were randomized so that this process involved meeting with a genetic counseling assistant or completed at the patient’s convenience via email instructions. Pre-test VGE included family history completion via electronic software and viewing of informational video. VGE completion and genetic testing uptake were measured for all participants. Questionnaires regarding satisfaction, and knowledge were optional for participants after VGE completion. Data was analyzed using t-test and Fisher’s exact. Results: Eighty-one individuals referred for genetic counseling from October 2020-March 2021, and 78 individuals were randomized (1:1) to assistant-led or patient-led VGE, with 39 individuals in each arm. After removing patients for technological limitations, loss to follow up, and procedural withdrawals, there were 18 patients in the assistant-led arm, and 16 patients in the patient-led arm. The primary reason for discontinuing the process was lack of response to phone and electronic contacts to schedule their genetics visit (n = 22). The median age was 64.5 years, with no difference between the two arms (p = 0.698). Participants identified primarily as white/Caucasian (n = 32, 94%). In the assistant-led group, all participants elected to undergo germline genetic testing and 13 (81%) opted for genetic testing in the patient-led group. There was no difference in genetic testing uptake between the two arms (p = 0.094). Nine patients in the patient-led group and eight patients in the assistant-led group completed the questionnaires. There was no difference in satisfaction with their VGE experience (p = 0.815) or knowledge using the KnowGene scale (p = 0.120). Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests there is no difference in genetic testing uptake when pre-test VGE is facilitated by a genetic counseling assistant or self-led by the patient. Given no preliminary differences in satisfaction and knowledge, patient-led pre-test VGE may serve as a viable option prior to germline testing in PCa patients. Additional research is needed with larger sample size. Furthermore, evaluation of the facilitators and barriers of VGE is needed as there was significant drop off in completion of video pre-test VGE.',\n",

       "  '69Background: While population-based estimates of advanced prostate cancer survivors are lacking, an estimated 180,000 men in the US are living with metastatic prostate cancer. Their survivorship experience is distinct from localized patients as they suffer quality of life detriments both due to the severity of disease and its therapies. We examined quality-of-life indictors among men in the IRONMAN global registry of advanced prostate cancer. Methods: IRONMAN (International Registry of Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer) is a population-based prospective study of men with newly diagnosed advanced, metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) enrolled from 16 countries. We report data from first 1865 men enrolled, 1567 who completed a baseline Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) in the US (N=581), Canada (N=245), Spain (N=166), UK (N=204), Australia (N=126), Switzerland (N=88), Sweden (N=70), Ireland (N=46), and Brazil (N=41). PROMs are collected at baseline and every three months using electronic (90%) or paper versions of validated questionnaires. Results: The cohort includes 1,128 men with mHSPC and 737 with CRPC. Based on self-report, 9% of men overall (18% in the US) are Black and 83% are white (78% in the US). Sleep problems were common among men at enrollment, with 59% of men reporting problems with insomnia. The prevalence was similarly high among men with mHSPC or CRPC disease. Ten percent of men reported that pain substantially interfered with daily activities, and 24% reported pain had some effect. Physical functioning was high among both mHSPC (median 93.3, 80-100) and CRPC (median 86.7, 73.3-100) patients based on EORTC QLQ-30. Global health status was similar between the two groups (median 75, 58.3 - 83.3). More than 25% of men reported some cognitive impairment at baseline. Financial difficulties due to the disease and treatment were quite high, ranging from 12% in Sweden, 16% in Canada and Spain, 34% in the US, and 46% in Brazil. Conclusions: Men with advanced prostate cancer experience a range of quality of life detriments which impair overall health. While at baseline, many of these measures were similar among men with mHSPC and CRPC, we will continue to monitor these over time to examine changes in quality of life associated with disease progression and treatments. A longer-term goal is to identify opportunities for intervention to improve quality of life and potentially improve survival. Clinical trial information: NCT03151629.',\n",

       "  '70 Background: Loeb et\\xa0al. recently highlighted that academic physicians were statistically more likely to recommend genetic testing to prostate cancer patients per NCCN guidelines compared to physicians at community practices. Several articles have outlined the rate of pathogenic mutations and metastasis free survival (MFS) for prostate cancer patients treated at academic institutions. However, there is a relative paucity of equivalent data regarding patients treated at community urology clinics. We felt it was important to retrospectively review data from our large community based uro-oncology practice and present our findings in an effort to clarify this topic. Methods: We collected data on 562 prostate cancer patients treated at our multidisciplinary uro-oncology clinic between 2016 and 2018. We found 363 patients that satisfied the inclusion criteria of having germline genetic mutation testing and at least 1 year of follow-up. Patients were stratified into three categories based on the results of their germline genetic test: negative for germline mutations, positive for germline pathogenic mutations, or positive for VUS (variant of uncertain significance) mutations. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) was conducted to assess for any differences in age, Gleason score, metastasis rate, and MFS across the groups. A significance level of.05 was used. Results: All patients were treated according to guideline recommendations as was standard for the practice. There was no statistically significant difference in average age or Gleason score between the groups. There was also no statistically significant difference between the MFS across the three groups. Although the metastasis rate and MFS in the group without any mutations (9.8%, 18.3 months) was clinically significant compared to the groups with pathogenic mutations (7.5%, 16.5 months) and VUS mutations (7%, 16.6 months), the differences were not statistically significant (p=.754 and.127 respectively). Conclusions: In our community based uro-oncology practice, we found no statistically significant difference in MFS between patients with pathogenic germline mutations, patients without germline mutations, and patients with VUS mutations at 1 year of follow-up. This does not exclude the possibility of an impact of germline mutations on MFS as the data matures to reach 5 or more years of follow-up.Results.Mutation status on Germline TestingSample SizeAge(years)Mean Gleason ScoreMedian Gleason ScoreMetastasis Rate(%)MFS(months)Negative26667.27.283 + 4 = 79.818.3Pathogenic Mutation4067.37.393 + 4 = 77.516.5VUS5765.97.343 + 4 = 77.0116.6p-value-.583.705-.754.127  ',\n",

       "  '71Background: In oncology practice, there are increasing numbers of patients for whom genetic testing is recommended by the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN), including all metastatic and high-risk localized prostate cancer patients. However, there is a critical shortage of genetics services providers. Acuity for these consults can be high, particularly in the context of a treatment related decision. We hypothesized that nurses, particularly advanced practice nurses (APNs), can provide a workforce within VA that can address genetic testing and genetic care needs of prostate cancer patients. Methods: We initiated a cancer genetics service staffed with an advanced practice nurse (APN) geneticist and evaluated the success of the program at a large urban, academic-affiliated Veteran’s Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). Results: In the one year prior to the initiation of the APN geneticist-run program (10/1/2019-9/30/2020), 61 unaffected patients with a family history of cancer and 85 patients with cancer (36 with prostate cancer) were referred to a VA centralized telegenetics service. An average of seven cancer patients (average three with prostate cancer) were referred to VA telegenetics per month. Genetic testing was completed in eleven (18%) of unaffected patients and 21 (25%) of cancer patients. Five (13%) of tested patients were found to have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation or variant of uncertain significance (VUS). In the eight months after initiation of the APN geneticist-run consult service (10/1/2020 - 5/30/2021), 39 unaffected patients with a family history of cancer and 90 patients with cancer (38 with prostate cancer) were referred. An average of 11 cancer patients (average five with prostate cancer) per month were referred. This represents a 57% increase in all cancer patient and a 67% increase in prostate cancer patient referrals. For those patients referred to the APN geneticist-run consult service, genetic testing was completed in three (7%) of unaffected patients and 30 (33%) of cancer patients (including 15 prostate cancer patients). The genetic testing rate therefore improved from 1.7 oncology patients per month to 3.9 oncology patients per month, an 130% increase in genetic testing. For prostate cancer patients, the genetic testing rate improved from 0.8 to 1.9 patients tested per month, representing a 137% increase. Comparison of genetic testing outcomes at one year will be included in the final presentation. Conclusions: Inclusion of an APN geneticist-run consult service embedded in oncology clinics will likely improve access to genetics services and genetic testing rates in cancer patients.',\n",

       "  '72Background: Identifying cancer cases within the electronic health record (EHR) or claims data can be challenging because diagnosis codes are often entered into patient records during routine screenings or as “rule out” diagnosis codes when the patient is referred to a procedure. To improve accuracy of prostate cancer (PCa) case ascertainment, we compared algorithms that used diagnoses codes to natural language processing (NLP) tools applied to clinical notes and pathology reports to identify Veterans with prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: This is a retrospective observational cohort study using VA EHR data to identify veterans diagnosed with PCa between 2000 and 2020. Using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 CM or ICD-9 CM) diagnosis and procedure codes, we identified veterans who may have PCa. We deployed validated NLP tools to identify the presence of Gleason score, metastatic PCa, and castration sensitivity to identify evidence of PCa within the notes. We conducted a descriptive analysis to compare the results of algorithms that relied exclusively on diagnosis codes compared to use of NLP tools. Results: From 2000 through 2020,1,031,296 veterans had one or more PCa diagnosis code. This number decreased by 11% for each additional PCa diagnosis code required. When we required 4 or more PCa diagnosis codes to be present, only 746,350 veterans had PCa. When we deployed NLP tools to identify mention of a Gleason score or an indicator of mPCa, only 685,847 Veterans had these indicators of PCa, a 35% decrease in the number of PCa cases with a single diagnosis code. Chart review of patients with their first PCa diagnosis codes in 2019 and 4 or more codes in their records illustrated no evidence of Gleason score or mPCa disease in their EHR. Analysis of their pathology reports revealed that these patients had prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation and had not yet developed prostate cancer. Conclusions: Accurate ascertainment of PCa using EHR and claims data requires using NLP tools and clinical notes combined with structured data sources such as diagnosis codes. Relying on ICD diagnosis codes alone will overestimate the burden of PCa up to 30%.',\n",

       "  '73Background: In phase 3 placebo (PBO)-controlled studies, addition of APA to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improved overall survival, resulted in rapid and deep PSA declines, and reduced risk of disease progression while preserving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC; SPARTAN) and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC; TITAN). This post hoc analysis evaluated the association of a deep PSA decline with PROs in these studies. Methods: Pts on ADT were randomized to APA (240 mg QD) or PBO: SPARTAN 2:1 (N = 1,207; APA n = 806), TITAN 1:1 (N = 1,052; APA n = 525). Each cycle was 28 d. PROs were assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF; TITAN only), and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI; TITAN only) at baseline, specific cycles during study treatment, and post progression up to 1 yr. A landmark analysis at Month 3 evaluated association between deep PSA decline (≤ 0.2 ng/mL) and time to subsequent deterioration in PROs (defined as decrease ≥ 10 points FACT-P total, ≥ 3 points Physical Wellbeing, ≥ 30% baseline for BPI-SF worst pain, or ≥ 2 points for BFI worst fatigue). At time of the landmark analysis, only pts continuing treatment were included; all deep PSA responses after, and all PRO deterioration events before, were ignored. Time-to-event end points were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Median treatment durations were 32.9 mo (SPARTAN) and 39.3 mo (TITAN). Per assessment, > 90% (SPARTAN, cycles 1-81) and > 50% (TITAN, cycles 1-33) of eligible pts completed FACT-P; BPI-SF and BFI, both > 62% (TITAN, cycles 1-33). Pts in either study who achieved PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at Month 3 had a lower risk of deterioration in FACT-P total or Physical Wellbeing (Table). Pts in TITAN with PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL at Month 3 had a lower risk of BPI-SF worst pain intensity or BFI worst fatigue intensity progression (Table). Conclusions: Deep and rapid PSA responses with APA were associated with prolonged time to deterioration in HRQoL, FACT-P Physical Wellbeing, BPI-SF worst pain intensity, and BFI worst fatigue intensity in pts with advanced PC.

       "  '74Background: Increased mortality from urologic cancers coupled with an aging population has resulted in patient care becoming more specialized to improve patient outcomes. Though family history, lifestyle behaviors, and genetics are all used to determine risk and treatment, there is a knowledge gap of whether mental illness (MI) should also be considered. Therefore, this study seeks to determine whether hospitalizations of urologic cancers plus MIs are associated with increased all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), costs of hospitalization and nosocomial infection rates. Methods: Inpatient data from 2016-2017 was obtained from the National Inpatient Sample database. This included all hospitalizations with at least one diagnosis of urologic cancer including prostate, bladder, kidney, renal pelvis, ureteral, urethral, testicular, and penile cancers. MIs of interest were depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and schizophrenia and related disorders. Data analysis and regression models were performed using SPSS Statistics. Reported odds ratios and significance values were controlled for Age, Sex, Income, Race, Insurance, Location, Mortality Risk, and Illness Severity. Results: There were 146,706 hospitalizations involving urologic cancers between 2016-2017. For these hospitalizations, depression and anxiety were associated with a decreased likelihood of death, and all MIs were associated with increased LOS. For hospitalizations involving prostate cancer, Depression and Substance Abuse were associated with decreased likelihood of death (all-causes). Hospitalizations involving kidney cancer had increased total charges and increased LOS. Hospitalizations involving bladder cancer were associated with decreased likelihood of death, and increased LOS for all MIs except, notably, those with substance abuse. Penile Cancer hospitalizations coded for anxiety showed increased LOS, and testicular cancer hospitalizations coded for substance abuse had increased likelihood of death. Conclusions: MIs can affect hospitalization outcomes of patients with urologic cancer differently based on the type of urologic cancer. Interestingly, our analysis showed that Depression was associated a decreased likelihood of death in hospitalizations coded for Prostate Cancer and Bladder Cancer. Though unexpected, we hypothesize that this finding may be partially due to implicit bias from healthcare providers that lead to enhanced care (e.g. increased patient monitoring, better support from auxiliary units such as Social Work). However, there is an absence of research in substantiating this claim. Further research is warranted to better assess the effect of Depression on the mortality of Urologic Cancer patients, and on how to best incorporate mental health status in the overall management of these patients.',\n",

       "  '75Background: Recruitment for most exercise trials is challenging and often hindered by participants’ inability to travel to the study centre and/or unwillingness to be randomized. Thus, patients in exercise randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are highly selected and may not reflect real-world experiences. Our objectives were to compare baseline characteristics and outcomes of men who agreed to participate in a preference-based trial (PREF) compared to a RCT of the same exercise interventions. Methods: A 2-arm multicentre PREF trial was conducted concurrently with a 2-arm RCT. Participants were men on ADT who were treated at 2 academic and 2 community hospitals in Canada and selected to engage in a group-based in-centre exercise intervention (GROUP) or a home-based exercise program (HOME). All participants underwent aerobic and resistance training 4-5 days per week for 6 months. Co-primary outcomes included fatigue (FACT-F) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Differences at baseline between the two trials were compared using ANOVA. Analysis of covariance with adjustment for baseline value was used to assess differences in the study outcomes between the two trials and between exercise arms. Results: 56 participants (mean age 70 y) consented and selected to participate in GROUP (n = 18) or HOME (n = 38). Recruitment rate was 21.5%. Retention at 6 months in the PREF and RCT was 72.7% and 50%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between participants of the two trials. Adherence was met by 60% of participants in PREF. Participants in PREF exhibited a 28.7-metre increase (better) in the 6MWT at 6 months compared to RCT participants (p = 0.20). Additionally, participants in PREF demonstrated less time (better) to complete 5 chair stands (mean change: -1.24s) at 6 months relative to participants in the RCT irrespective of exercise mode (p = 0.06). HOME participants in the PREF completed the 5 chair stands faster (mean change: -2.19s) compared to HOME participants in the RCT (p = 0.01). Similarly, GROUP participants in the RCT required less time (mean change: -2.11s) for 5 chair stands compared to GROUP participants in the PREF (p = 0.04). Hip circumference was higher (worse) at 6 months in PREF participants (mean change: +2.95cm) compared to their RCT counterparts (p = 0.02). Although fatigue was not significantly different between participants in the two studies at 6 months, GROUP participants in the RCT experienced worse fatigue (mean change: -6.93) compared to those who selected GROUP (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Allowing participants to select the exercise intervention of their preference may improve retention and ameliorate functional declines as a result of ADT. Further studies that assess the effects of preference-based trials on clinical outcomes are warranted. Clinical trial information: NCT03335631.',\n",

       "  '76Background: The benefits of Electronic Patient Remote Outcomes (e-PRO) for telemonitoring are well established, allowing early detection of illnesses and continuous monitoring of patients. We have previously shown high levels of compliance of use of telemonitoring in daily care. This new PROTECTY study assesses the predictive power of patient health status in the first month of treatment on survival, evaluated with the telemonitoring platform Cureety. Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the Military Hospital Bégin on prostate cancer patients. Patients were allowed to respond to a symptomatology questionnaire based on CTCAE v.5.0, personalized to their pathology and treatment. An algorithm evaluates the health status of the patient based on the reported adverse events, with a classification into 2 different states: Good Health status (A) Poor Health status (B) In case of A, the patient received therapeutic advice to help manage each of the reported adverse events. In case of B, the patient is invited to call the hospital. For the purpose of this analysis, we collected their health status during the first month after initiation of treatment. The primary endpoint was to assess if the first month health status is a predictive factor of progression free-survival (PFS) for prostate cancer patient. The secondary endpoint was to assess if the first month health status is a predictive factor of overall survival (OS) for prostate cancer patient. Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled between July 1st, 2020 and June 30st, 2021. The median age was 74.0 (range 58.0 – 94.0). 62% presented a metastatic stage, and the most represented cancer was mHSPC with 39,5% among metastatic patients. Overall, 2443 questionnaires were completed by the patients, 4.0% resulted in a health classification in state B. 86,9% of patient were classified in group A the first month. 13,1% of patient were classified in group B the first month. The median follow up was 12.3 months. PFS at 12 months was 89% in A group vs 60% in B group, p=0,17 OS at 12 months was 100% in A group vs 86% in B group, p=0,15. Conclusions: Our study is the first to assess the impact of tolerance treatment on survival. The initial results suggest that e-PRO assessment by the platform could help identify in the early stages the patients that require further health assessment and potential therapeutic changes. While further follow-up of more patients will be required, our study highlights the importance of e-PRO in cancer patient care.',\n",

       "  '77Background: Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a conserved cell surface protein in PC and is used for targeted imaging and therapeutics. Antibodies circulate longer than small molecules and are less likely to reach luminal PSMA on normal organs. Here we report PROs and longer-term AEs from the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of a first-in-human study of combined monoclonal antibody and potent alpha emitter (225Ac-J591). Methods: Eligible subjects with mCPRC were administered 225Ac-J591. Initial to maximum doses were 13.3 to 93.3 KBq/kg). AEs are reporting using CTCAE v5 and PROs, including pain (BPI-SF) and quality of life (QOL, FACT-P), and associations with PSA response were also examined. Results: A total of 32 subjects (one enrolled in both dose-escalation and expansion) were treated with a single dose of 225Ac-J591 across 7 dose levels with expansion at the level (93.3 KBq/kg, n = 16). Median age 69.5 (52-89) and PSA 149.1 (4.8-7168.4). All subjects had at least 1 AE of any grade. Most common were fatigue (31/32, 1 Gr > 2), anorexia (25/32, all Gr 1-2), and thrombocytopenia (25/32, 3 Gr 3, 2 Gr 4). Xerostomia was observed in 14/32 subjects (all Gr 1), 7 of whom had prior 177Lu-PSMA. Pain flare was reported in 43% (17/32) subjects (11 Gr 1, 6 Gr 2). 19 had evaluable PROs at baseline and efficacy visit (week 12). Pain severity (p = 0.8) and interference from pain (p = 0.4) were unchanged from baseline to 12 weeks, yet better PSA response (by percent) was associated with reduced pain severity (r = 0.7, p = 0.0023). Despite at least one AE in each subject, total FACT-P was not significantly changed after treatment (p = 0.2), but emotional well-being declined over time (15 [10.0, 18.0] v 10.0 [7.5, 13.0], p = 0.011). Reduction in median emotional well-being reached clinically important score differences. When stratified by AE, subjects with xerostomia had lower FACT-P total scores, but no difference was observed between those with and without pain. PSA response was not associated with change in QOL or subscales. Conclusions: Pain and quality of life in subjects with mCRPC did not change, on average, from baseline to 12 weeks after treatment with 225Ac-J591. This is despite preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy being accompanied by frequent, treatment emergent AEs. A promising trend toward improved pain in those with PSA response warrants further analysis. Small numbers limited statistical power for testing other subgroup associations. Additional correlations with pretreatment sites of disease, performance status, and adverse event distribution are ongoing. Assessment of changes in PROs in the follow up studies [NCT04506567] are underway. Clinical trial information: NCT03276572.',\n",

       "  '78Background: Multiple treatments with similar efficacy exist for mPC resulting in multifaceted treatment choices. Shared decision-making (SDM) engages patients and may be associated with superior outcomes in men with prostate cancer. We assessed the association of decision locus of control (DLOC) (SDM vs. physician- or patient-directed decisions) and measures of patient quality of life (QOL), including patient reported functional outcomes, and decision satisfaction. Methods: Patients completed surveys of decision-making practices after a clinic visit in which a decision occurred. Patients also completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 QOL instrument at baseline (time of decision), and 2- and 4-months. Scores for each QOL dimension and pain were calculated for each time point, and the least-squared means were compared among DLOC groups to evaluate for associations using a mixed effects model. Results: 101 patients participated, with median age of 69 years [range: 49-92]. Most patients were white (80%) and married (82%). A majority of patients reported experiencing SDM in the clinic visit assessed (63, 62%). At baseline, there was no significant difference in patient reported QOL dimensions among DLOC groups, but patients reporting physician-directed decisions reported significantly greater baseline pain than the SDM group (Table). At 4 months, patient reported physical functioning was superior among patients reporting patient-directed (p=0.005) or SDM (p=0.03) than those who reported physician-directed decision-making. There was a trend toward greater decision satisfaction among patients who reported patient-directed (p=0.06) or SDM (p=0.10) at 4-months compared to men reporting physician-directed decision-making. There were no differences at 4 months for social, emotional, cognitive, or role functioning between DLOC groups. Conclusions: Patients who reported greater control during treatment decisions had superior physical functioning and a trend toward greater decision satisfaction at 4 months compared with patients reporting physician-directed decisions, suggesting measurable domains of benefit from involvement in the decision-making process. Continued research evaluating the association between physical and psychological outcomes and DLOC is needed, including larger studies within more diverse populations.Dimension (Range)Difference from Physician-Directed ScoreSDM Score (P-Value)Patient-Directed Score (P-Value)Baseline Pain[0-100]-11.5 (0.04)-11.1 (0.08)4-monthPhysical Functioning [0-100]11.1 (0.03)16.3 (0.005)Role Functioning [0-100]1.9 (0.81)9.1 (0.30)Emotional Functioning [0-100]5.6 (0.18)7.3 (0.11)Cognitive Functioning [0-100]-2.4 (0.58)-0.3 (0.95)Social Functioning [0-100]-4.5 (0.47)0.3 (0.97)Average Satisfaction [0-5]0.29 (0.10)0.37 (0.06)Note: Higher score indicates higher function/satisfaction or greater pain.',\n",

       "  '79Background: Enzalutamide (ENZ) is used to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Quality of life (QOL) during ENZ treatment for CRPC patients is very important, but the markers that predict QOL are unknown. We investigated the relationship between serum testosterone (T) levels before ENZ and QOL changes in CRPC patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective study from 2014 to 2018 at Gunma University Hospital and related facilities. We analyzed 95 patients who were able to evaluate QOL by FACT-P before, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after ENZ administration. We measured serum T levels using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This study was approved by the institutional review board of Gunma University Hospital (No.1177). Results: The study population of 95 patients had a median age of 72 years and median PSA of 21.6 ng/ml. The median overall survival from the time of ENZ administration in 95 cases was 26.8 months. The median serum T levels before ENZ treatment was 50.0 pg/ml. The mean total FACT-P score before ENZ administration, 4 weeks and 12 weeks later were 95.8, 91.7, and 90.1, respectively. 95 patients were divided into two groups, a high T levels (T-High) group and a low T (Low-T) group, and changes in FACT-P were examined. The mean FCAT-P values in the High-T and Low-T groups were 98.5 and 84.6 after 4 weeks and 96.4 and 82.2 after 12 weeks, which were significantly higher in the High-T group (p < 0.05, respectively). In the Low-T group, the mean FACT-P value after 12 weeks was significantly lower than that before administration (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It was suggested that the serum T levels of CRPC patients before ENZ treatment may be useful for predicting marker of QOL changes after ENZ treatment.',\n",

       "  '80Background: Nine new treatments for mCRPC, each varying in efficacy and safety, have been approved over the last 10 years, changing the landscape of patient management. Understanding how patients perceive and value the efficacy, safety, and administration burden of these treatments can facilitate shared-decision making to determine optimal management. To our knowledge, this study is the first to elicit patient preferences for mCRPC treatments in the US. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the discrete-choice experiment (DCE) method, in which participants were asked to state their choices over successive sets of treatment alternatives, defined by varying levels of treatment characteristics (i.e., attributes). Six treatment attributes in this DCE were examined: overall survival (OS), months until patients develop a fracture or bone metastasis, likelihood of requiring radiation to control bone pain, fatigue, nausea, and mode of administration. The levels taken by each of these attributes were selected to reflect clinical practice. Quota sampling was used in an online panel for recruitment to ensure that study sample is representative of the US prostate cancer population by age distribution. The choice responses were used to determine the value (i.e., preference weights) respondents placed on each attribute via the use of conditional and mixed logit models. The importance of attributes and marginal rates of substitutions were also calculated in order to understand how much patients were willing to trade off between different attributes. Results: The final dataset included 160 participants, with a mean age of 71.6 years old and a mean of 8.96 years since prostate cancer diagnosis. Participants noted their preferences for mCRPC treatments characteristics as follows (in decreasing order of importance over the attribute ranges included in the study): OS (relative attribute importance [RAI]: 31%), reduction in the need for bone pain control (23%), nausea (16%), months until patients develop a fracture or bone metastasis (15%), fatigue (11%), and mode of administration (3%). The marginal rates of substitution demonstrated that eliminating moderate nausea was perceived as equivalent to a 1.9-month reduction in OS, and a reduction of fatigue from severe to mild was perceived as equivalent to a reduction in OS of approximately 3.3 months. Conclusions: Improving OS remains the highest priority, but patients are willing to sacrifice some survival to avoid declines in quality of life, including avoiding bone pain/fracture, nausea, and fatigue, in the mCRPC disease state.',\n",

       "  '81Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer may result in accelerated aging that increases the risk for falls. Falls are higher in men with a history of ADT use, even if treatment is discontinued, compared to men never on ADT. Less is known, however, about the specific patient characteristics that might be associated with falls. Methods: We analyzed data from prostate cancer survivors with a history of ADT and who had enrolled in an ongoing NIH-funded fall prevention exercise trial (NCT03741335). To be eligible for the trial, men were 1) currently or previously treated with ADT and 2) reported a fall in the previous 6 months or had evidence of fall risk. Fall risk was assessed through slow times on a 5 time sit-to-stand test (5XSTS; sec) or timed up and go walk test (TUG; sec). For this analysis we compared men with a positive fall history to men with no recent falls but evidence of fall risk. We compared age, ADT history (past vs current), body mass index (BMI), self-report comorbidities from the Charlson Comorbidity Index, physical function and disability from the LLFDI, pain from the BPI, anxiety from PROMIS, depressive symptoms from the CES-D, fear of falling and activity restrictions from the SAFFE, and physical activity from CHAMPS, as well as objective measures of strength and mobility using 5XSTS and TUG. Results: A total of 171 cases (mean age 73.1 +/- 7.1 years of age) were available for analysis, with 58 men (34%) reporting a fall in the 6 months prior to enrollment. Of reported falls, 11% were injurious falls, with 4% requiring medical attention. Injuries included fractures (n = 4), head injury (n = 2), joint injury (n = 3), and bruises/scrapes (n = 8). Fallers reported significantly lower levels of physical functioning (p < 0.001), greater levels of disability (p < 0.01), greater fear of falling (p < 0.001), more activity restrictions due to falls worry (p < 0.02) and slower TUG times (p < 0.03), than men who had not recently fallen. There were no significant differences between men with established fall history and men with fall risk only on age, ADT history, comorbidities, BMI, pain, anxiety, depressive symptoms, physical activity, or 5XSTS (p for all > 0.05). Conclusions: Among our preliminary sample of men with a history of ADT use and enrolled in an ongoing fall prevention trial, men with an established fall history functioned less independently, were more worried about falls and apt to restrict their activities accordingly, and had poorer mobility than men who hadn’t recently fallen. From our cross-sectional design we cannot determine whether poorer functioning and mobility and greater fear of falling were antecedents or consequences of a recent fall. Regardless, interventions designed to prevent falls in men exposed to ADT are critical to prevent potential injurious falls and to keep men functioning independently.',\n",

       "  '82Background: Treatment options for older adults with mPC expanded significantly in recent years but commonly include chemotherapy with Docetaxel (Chemo), androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies (ARAT), and Radium-223 (Ra-223). Symptom burden associated with Chemo, ARAT, and Ra-223 is frequently observed and often leads to treatment modification, especially in older men. The objective of this study is to explore how often, and which moderate to severe symptoms during treatment for mPC and triggered follow-up, lead to treatment delay and/or dose reduction. Methods: Men aged 65+ with mPC starting standard dose (n=24) or reduced dose (n=1) Chemo, standard dose (n=41) or reduced dose (n=1) ARATs, or Ra223 (n=12) from two tertiary cancer centres in Toronto, Canada, were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Participants self-reported symptoms daily using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) for 3-4 weeks either through a web-based interface or phone calls. ESAS scores of >4 were followed by ‘triggered’ detailed questionnaires. The oncology care team was informed of reportable events based on scores of triggered questionnaires and patients were advised to call their care team. Clinical and treatment data were abstracted from electronic patient records and descriptive analysis was used. Results: 52/79 participants (66%) reported 345 moderate to severe symptoms that merited triggered questionnaires (table) with an adherence of 83%. Tiredness (n=74), appetite (n=49), insomnia (n=49), and pain (n=48) were the most frequently reported symptoms. 28 patients reported high scores on triggered questionnaires that led to informing the oncology care team and 79% of these patients were contacted by the care team, or an appointment with the Most Responsible Physician was scheduled. Moderate to severe symptom reporting resulted in treatment modification for 9 patients, Chemo (n=5), ARAT (n=3), and Ra-223 (n=1). Conclusions: Daily monitoring identified clinically relevant symptoms and actionable concerns. Informing care teams of reportable adverse events resulted in contacting patients and ultimately in treatment modification in a considerable number of patients.

       "  '83Background: Mounting evidence support a role for statins in improving survival in advanced prostate cancer (PC), particularly among men on androgen-ablative therapies. This study aimed to systemically review and meta-analyze the relationship between statin use and survival among men with PC on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies (ARATs). Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and reported in compliance with the MOOSE guidelines. Medline, Embase, Epub Ahead of Print, Cochrane CT, Cochrane SR, and Web of Science were searched from inception to May 18, 2021, for observational studies reporting associations of postdiagnostic statin use and survival outcomes (hazard ratios [HRs]). Two authors independently abstracted all data. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcomes included overall mortality (OM) and Prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Summary estimates pooled multivariable HRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the generic inverse variance method with random-effects modelling. Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified. A priori subgroup and sensitivity analyses were undertaken, and publication bias was evaluated. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Results: Twenty-five cohorts of 119,878 men (64,717 statin users [54%]) with over 74,416 mortality events were included. Postdiagnostic statin use was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of OM (19 cohorts, HR 0.73 [95%CI: 0.66 to 0.82], I2= 83%) and a 35% reduction in the risk of PCSM (14 cohorts, HR 0.65 [95%CI: 0.58 to 0.73], I2= 74%), with significant heterogeneity in both estimates. Subgroup analyses identified a PCSM-advantage of statins for men on ARATs compared to ADT (HR 0.40 [95%CI: 0.30 to 0.55] vs HR 0.68 [95%CI: 0.60 to 0.76], p-difference < 0.01). Confidence in the overall evidence was “low” for both outcomes. Conclusions: Postdiagnostic statin use reduced both overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality in men on androgen-ablative therapies for advanced PC. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings.',\n",

       "  '84Background: Ephrin receptors and their membrane-localized ligands induce bidirectional signaling and facilitate tumor-stroma interactions. Expression of EphB4 is increased in prostate cancer tissue and cell lines and retained in castration resistant states, and can promote cell migration, invasion, and metastases. Blocking the EphB4-EphrinB2 pathway, which can be accomplished by soluble EphB4 conjugated to human serum albumin (sEphB4-HSA), has efficacy in preclinical models of aggressive prostate cancer. A phase I clinical trial of sEphB4-HSA led to response or stable disease in 56% of patients, with no grade 4 or 5 related adverse events, and combination pembrolizumab sEphB4-HSA led to a 52% response rate in EphrinB2 expressing urothelial cancer. We hypothesized that targeting the EphB4-EphrinB2 pathway may serve as a therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: We conducted a single arm, phase II trial in patients with progressive mCRPC and treatment with at least one second generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy but no more than three prior therapies for mCRPC. On Day 1 of each cycle patients received sEphB4-HSA 1000 mg IV, with cycle length 14 days cycles 1-6 and cycle length 21 days for cycle 7 and beyond. The primary endpoint was confirmed prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate (confirmed decrease in PSA by > 50%). We employed a Simon two stage Minimax design, requiring two or more responses among the first 15 patients to enroll an additional ten patients. Results: Fourteen eligible patients enrolled in the study. Median age was 73.5 years (range 52-83), patients had a median baseline PSA value of 65.11 ng/mL (range 7.77-2850 ng/mL) and received a median of three prior therapies (range 1-3) for mCRPC. Ten patients received prior taxane for mCRPC or hormone sensitive prostate cancer. The median length of treatment with sEphB4-HSA was 6.5 weeks (range 2-35 weeks). The potentially treatment-related adverse events (AEs) that occurred in more than 25% of patients were hypertension (10 patients) and fatigue (7 patients). Three patients experienced a serious adverse event potentially related to therapy, including one patient with a grade 5 event (cerebral vascular accident) possibly related to study drug. No patient had a confirmed PSA response, and the study was stopped for futility. Thirteen patients had PSA progression ( > 25% increase in PSA), and one patient withdrew due to toxicity prior to having an evaluable PSA response. The median time to PSA progression was 28 days (95% CI 28-64 days), and median time to radiologic progression was 55 days (95% CI 55 days-NR). Of three patients with measurable disease, two had stable disease and one had progressive disease. Conclusions: In patients with mCRPC who progressed on prior second generation AR-targeted therapy, sEphB4-HSA monotherapy had no discernable anti-tumor activity.

       "  '85Background: In the VISION trial, targeted radioligand therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 significantly prolonged radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) and overall survival when added to standard of care (SoC) in patients with advanced prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. There was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 + SoC vs SoC. However, treatment exposure was more than three times longer in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 + SoC arm and thus relative toxicity may have been overestimated. A post hoc analysis of the relationship between exposure and frequency of TEAEs was performed to facilitate comparison of rates between arms. Methods: In this international, open-label study, adult patients previously treated with ≥ 1 androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and 1–2 taxane regimens were randomized 2:1 to 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq Q6W, ≤ 6 cycles) + SoC or SoC. Safety was a secondary endpoint. TEAEs (regardless of causality) were reported from start of randomized treatment for up to 30 days after last treatment administration (including SoC) or 1 day before subsequent anticancer treatment, whichever occurred first. Overall TEAE incidence was adjusted for treatment exposure by calculating incidence per 100 patient treatment-years (PTY). The analysis was performed for the first occurrence of TEAEs. Results: Exposure-adjusted incidence of any grade, grade ≥ 3 and selected TEAEs are listed in the table. There was similar exposure-adjusted incidence of gastrointestinal events and fatigue and higher exposure-adjusted incidence of musculoskeletal and renal events with SoC compared with 177Lu-PSMA-617 + SoC suggesting an association with treatment exposure rather than 177Lu-PSMA-617. Dry mouth, dry eye and acute myelosuppression maintained a higher incidence, confirming relationship with 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. Conclusions: The adjusted safety analysis, accounting for a longer safety observation due to longer rPFS in patients receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617, reveals a comparable incidence of TEAEs between arms. This confirms a favorable risk/benefit profile of 177Lu-PSMA-617 added to SoC in this patient population.

       "  '86Background: Treatment options for patients with mCSPC have rapidly evolved with the introduction of androgen receptor axis targeted therapies (ARATs) and chemotherapy. The GURC cohort study is a phase 4, multicentre, non-interventional, longitudinal cohort study of Canadian men with advanced prostate cancer. We prospectively examined the evolving real world management and treatment patterns of patients with mCSPC, with a focus on treatment intensification beyond ADT and germline DNA damage repair (DDR) testing. Methods: Clinical management patterns, baseline patient characteristics, germline DDR alteration status, treatment intensification with ARATs (abiraterone acetate [AA], apalutamide [Apa], enzalutamide [Enza]) and chemotherapy within the mCSPC cohort were analyzed. Results: 204 patients with mCSPC were enrolled from 2018 to 2021 across 25 Canadian sites. The median age was 71 (range 64 - 77), median PSA at study entry was 24, 88% (158/180) of patients had de novo mCSPC, 69% (110/204) of patients had a Gleason Score > 7, and 4% (2/49) of the patients who received a germline testing harbored a germline DDR alteration (BRCA2 = 1, MUTYH/MEN1 = 1). The distribution of high and low volume mCSPC at study entry was 62% (118/189) and 37% (71/189), respectively. Overall, patients received ADT alone 27% (51/189), AA 45% (86/189), apalutamide 17% (33/189), docetaxel 8% (15/189), and enzalutamide 3% (6/189). Treatment intensification with ARATs/docetaxel was administered to 69% [141/189]) of patients. Patients treated with ADT alone had a significantly lower volume of disease at treatment initiation (low volume rates of 49% [24/49] in ADT alone vs 33% [47/143] in treatment intensified patients, p = 0.044). Among those receiving treatment intensification with ARATs/docetaxel, time to intensification was ≤ 3 months in 78.5 % (113/144). Conclusions: This cohort study demonstrates that patients with mCSPC continue to receive ADT alone and docetaxel over time, despite an ever-increasing list of accessible ARATs. Patients receiving ADT alone appear to have lower volume of disease. Germline DDR testing is not yet comprehensively performed. This underlines the real world need to provide greater education and resources to encourage ARAT treatment and genetic testing in this setting.',\n",

       "  '87Background: DS-7300 is an antibody drug conjugate with an exatecan derivative payload that targets B7-H3, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Initial findings from an ongoing phase 1/2 dose escalation study for advanced solid tumors, and dose-expansion studies in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and mCRPC (NCT04145622) showed that DS-7300 was generally well tolerated with early signs of clinical activity (ESMO 2021, abstract 513O). Here, we present preliminary results from the mCRPC pt subset. Methods: This study consisted of 2 parts: dose- escalation (part 1) and expansion (part 2). Part 1 assessed the safety and tolerability of DS-7300 with doses ranging from 0.8 to 16 mg/kg. A dose of 12 mg/kg was selected for part 2. Part 2 assessed safety and prospective efficacy of DS-7300 in the selected tumor types, including mCRPC. DS-7300 was administered intravenously every 3 weeks in parts 1 and 2. Results: At data cutoff (August 8, 2021), 29 pts with mCRPC from the US and Japan were enrolled in parts 1 (n = 24) and 2 (n = 5). Pts enrolled in this study were heavily pretreated, with a median of 6.0 (range, 2-10) and 5.0 (range, 3-10) prior lines of therapy in parts 1 and 2, respectively. Baseline B7-H3 expression was highly prevalent in the study population. Enrolled pts were 44 to 82 years of age (median, 68.0 years) and had an ECOG performance status ≤1. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 29 pts (100.0%) in parts 1 and 2, with 7 pts (21.4%) with TEAEs leading to dose interruption, 2 pts (6.9%) with TEAEs leading to dose reduction, and no pts with TEAEs associated with drug discontinuation. The most common (≥20%) all-grade (Gr) TEAEs were nausea (65.5%), infusion-related reactions (IRRs; 34.5%), fatigue (34.5%), chills (31.0%), vomiting (31.0%), anemia (27.6%), diarrhea (27.6%), and dehydration (20.7%). Gr ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 10 pts (34.5%); the most common was anemia (17.2%). There were no Gr ≥3 treatment-related serious TEAEs (SAEs) reported. All IRR cases were Gr 1/2 and manageable with supportive care. No ILD/pneumonitis cases were reported. RECIST responses were observed in pts treated with DS-7300 between 6.4- and 16.0-mg/kg doses, including 6 partial responses (4 confirmed) and 15 stable diseases. The median duration of treatment was 13.9 weeks (range, 3-40 weeks) in part 1 and 6.0 weeks (range, 3-9.14 weeks) in part 2. At data cutoff, 8 pts (66.7%) in the 12.0-mg/kg group in part 1 and 4 pts (80.0%) in part 2 were ongoing treatment. Moreover, preliminary data indicate improvements in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and bone metastases. Conclusions: DS-7300 was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in pts with mCRPC. The preliminary safety and efficacy data are encouraging and warrant further investigation. Clinical trial information: NCT04145622.',\n",

Preclinical studies combining a PARPi (olaparib) and DNA damage checkpoint inhibitor (ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib) show synergy, providing the rationale to test this combination in men with mCRPC, including where single agent olaparib has been shown to be active. Methods: Two cohorts were accrued to a trial combining ceralasertib with olaparib in men a) with or b) without DNA repair defects. All patients progressed on ≥1 prior mCRPC therapy with no prior PARPi or platinum chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease response (confirmed PSA decline ≥50% and/or RECIST response), while disease progression was defined per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 definition. Each cohort is analyzed independently for disease endpoints, while both groups were combined for toxicity assessments. Results: The 12 person DNA repair-deficient (DRDef) cohort allowed patients with germline BRCA2 loss (n = 4), somatic BRCA2 loss (n = 1) and ATM loss (n = 1 germline, n = 5 somatic and n = 1 somatic with unknown germline). 35 men without BRCA2/BRCA1 or ATM genomic loss were accrued to the DNA repair-proficient (DRPro) cohort. These men had next-generation sequencing (NGS) on contemporary biopsies (prior to enrolment without intervening therapy, 12), prior NGS on metastatic tissue (10), prior NGS on primary prostatic tissue (n = 3), or cell-free analyses (5). Five patients have incomplete cell-free analyses. At data cutoff (October 2021), in the DRDef cohort, the response rate by confirmed ≥50% PSA decline was 4/10 (40%) including 3 of 4 BRCA2 patients, and another is awaiting sufficient follow up; 1 of 6 ATM-deficient patients responded and another is awaiting sufficient follow up. All 4 DRDef responders remain on therapy (median of 8 months). For patients in the DRPro cohort who have completed therapy and response assessment (n = 21), 3 responded, one with a duration of 12 months, two with 6 months. An updated analysis will be presented. Conclusions: This analysis suggests potential activity of the doublet for DRDef (BRCA2 mainly) and DRPro mCRPC. Ongoing biomarker analysis (e.g. ATM IHC, contemporaneous cell-free DNA analysis rather than archived tissue) may help guide selection of patients most likely to benefit.

       "  '89Background: Addition of androgen receptor signaling inhibitors to ADT + DOC has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in pts with mCSPC. TITAN, a placebo-controlled phase 3 study, showed that APA + ADT improved overall survival (OS) and other clinical outcomes in mCSPC (Chi, J Clin Oncol 2021). This post hoc analysis of TITAN evaluated outcomes in pts who had received DOC prior to treatment with APA + ADT versus those who did not. Methods: In TITAN, 1052 pts were randomized 1:1 to APA (240 mg QD) or placebo added to ongoing ADT. We assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), OS, and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in pts receiving DOC and ADT prior to adding APA vs those receiving only ADT plus APA. Outcomes by prior DOC were also assessed in pts with high- or low-volume disease at randomization (baseline [BL]) per adapted CHAARTED criteria, or those with matched BL characteristics. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and p values. rPFS was assessed using the first interim analysis cutoff (23 mo median follow-up); OS and time to PSA progression were assessed using the final analysis cutoff (44 mo median follow-up). Results: A total of 58/525 (11%) pts from the APA + ADT group had received DOC prior to randomization: 76% (n = 44) had high-volume disease, 62% (n = 36) had bone-only metastases, 16% (n = 9) had visceral metastases, and 59% (n = 34) had > 10 bone lesions. In the overall APA-treated population and in the subset of pts with high-volume disease, OS, rPFS, and time to PSA progression were similar in those who received prior DOC and those who did not (Table). Pts with low-volume disease also had similar results, although the number of pts was small. Clinical outcomes in pts with matched BL characteristics (including PSA and time from initial diagnosis to randomization, among others) were similar regardless of prior use of DOC (Table). The safety profile of APA was not substantially different between pts with or without prior DOC. Limitations of this analysis include lack of data on tumor volume and other disease characteristics at the initiation of prior DOC treatment; interpretation was based on small number of pts with prior DOC (only 11% of TITAN pts), most notably in the rPFS analysis. Conclusions: Prior use of DOC in pts with mCSPC did not further improve clinical benefits of APA + ADT in TITAN.

       "  '90Background: Darolutamide, a structurally distinct and highly potent androgen receptor inhibitor, had a consistently favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in ARAMIS, and discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs) remained consistently low after longer follow-up. In previously reported phase 1/2 studies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), darolutamide was well tolerated for up to 25 months. We report the safety and tolerability of extended treatment with darolutamide in these mCRPC studies. Methods: Data from three phase 1/2 studies (NCT02363855, NCT01317641/NCT01429064, and NCT01784757) in patients with mCRPC were pooled for analysis of long-term safety. Results are summarized descriptively. Results: Of 173 patients with mCRPC evaluable for safety in the 3 studies, 13 patients received > 2 years of darolutamide treatment; median duration of treatment was 38 months (range 24–90). Six patients received > 4 years of darolutamide treatment. Nine of 13 patients with > 2 years of darolutamide therapy initially received 600 mg BID; others received 200 mg (n = 1), 300 mg (n = 1), or 700 mg (n = 2) BID. Median age was 68 years in the > 2-years group, and most patients were white. Patients were enrolled from France (n = 4), Latvia (n = 3), United Kingdom (n = 3), Finland (n = 2), and Japan (n = 1). Most patients had normal renal function (n = 10) and hepatic function (n = 10), 12 patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and 9 patients had a Gleason score ≥7. Prior systemic anticancer treatments taken by more than 1 patient were bicalutamide (n = 10); cyproterone (n = 3); and triptorelin and leuprorelin (n = 2 each). No patient received prior chemotherapy. All 13 patients reported AEs, most grade 1 or 2; 6 reported grade 3 AEs. Treatment-related AEs were reported in 5 patients, and all were grade 1 in severity. Serious AEs were reported in 6 patients, and all were judged not related to darolutamide. One patient treated with darolutamide for > 2 years had an AE (new neoplasm; not related to darolutamide) that led to treatment discontinuation. Conclusions: Extended darolutamide treatment > 2 years in this small group of patients with mCRPC was generally well tolerated, with safety and tolerability consistent with that previously reported.

       "  '91Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapies are being pursued for the treatment of mCRPC. Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) is highly expressed on the surface membrane in mCRPC and with limited expression on normal tissues. We undertook a phase 1, first-in-human study of a PSCA-targeted 4-1BB-co-stimulated CAR T cell therapy in mCRPC. Methods: CAR T cells were manufactured at City of Hope’s cGMP facility. The trial followed the Target equivalence range design with an equivalence range of.20-.35 and too toxic level of 0.51 following participants in cohorts of 3. The plan was to begin at a dose of 100 million (M) without lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, then add LD to 100M prior to dose escalation to maximum 600M. Patients (pts) were required to have disease progression after at least 1 androgen receptor targeted therapy but there was no limit on prior chemotherapy or other treatments. Primary objective is to define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase 2 dose as well as to describe preliminary bioactivity and efficacy. Correlative studies include MRI for target bone lesion response, CAR T cell persistence, circulating tumor cells, and serum cytokines. Results: 12 pts have been treated to date, median age 68 (42-72). Three pts were treated at the 100M dose with no DLTs. In the 100M plus LD dose level there 2 pts experienced DLT of grade 3 cystitis non-infective and fatigue. The protocol was amended to reduce the LD dose to 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide D1-3 and intensify monitoring with early intervention for cystitis. No DLT occurred in 3 pts treated in the modified LD 100M cohort. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), DLTs and best response by RECIST are presented by dose level in the table. PSA declines (one >90%) were seen as well as radiographic improvement, though RECIST response was limited to stable disease (SD) by concurrent bone metastases. Correlative studies indicated bioactivity of PSCA-CAR T cells. Conclusions: PSCA-CAR T cell therapy is feasible in pts with mCRPC with DLT of cystitis, and shows preliminary anti-tumor effect at a dose of 100M plus LD. Dose escalation to 300M may proceed.

       "  '92Background: Abiraterone (AA) and Enzalutamide (ENZ) are both hormone therapies used in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Due to a lack of large comparative studies, they are currently used interchangeably, but may have different adverse outcomes in patients with comorbid conditions. In this study, we aim to identify adverse events that lead to hospitalization in patients treated with ENZ versus AA. Methods: Patients treated with AA or ENZ between September 10, 2014 and June 3, 2017 were identified in the Veterans Health Administration and followed until April 2020. We obtained ICD 9/10 codes using the Veterans Health Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) platform among VA hospitalizations. We used the top 3 ICD 9/10 codes at discharge to ascertain causation of hospitalization. Infections were defined by ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes falling into 3 categories: pneumonia (ICD9: 480.x-486.x, ICD10: J13.x-J18.x), urinary tract infection (ICD9: 599.0, ICD10: N39.0), and sepsis (ICD9: 995.91, 995.92, ICD10: A40.x-A41.x, R65.20, R65.21). Results: 5,822 patients were identified for the cohort. The mean age of the patients was 75.3 years old, with a mean Charlson comorbidity index of 4.2. Patients first treated with enzalutamide were older (75.8 vs 75.0 years, p = 0.002) with a higher mean Charlson comorbidity score (4.4 vs 4.1, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in time from initial diagnosis of PCa to treatment with AA or ENZ. Of the 5,822 patients, 2504 (43.0%) were initially treated with ENZ, and 3,318 (57.0%) with AA. Total hospitalization rate in events/person-years was 1.52 and 1.29 for the abiraterone and enzalutamide cohorts respectively, with an incidence rate difference (IDR) of 0.23 (p < 0.0001, CI: 0.14-0.32), indicating a statistically significant increase in hospitalizations among the abiraterone cohort. Of the total hospitalizations, 1/4th of them were caused by infections defined as pneumonia, sepsis, or UTI. The incidence in events/person-years for the combined infections in the AA and ENZ cohort was 0.99 and 0.86 (IDR = 0.13, p = 0.06) respectively, 0.97 and 0.86 (IDR = 0.11, p = 0.26) for UTI; 0.76 and 0.74 (IDR = 0.021, p = 0.82) for sepsis; and 0.82 and 0.71 (IDR = 0.12, p = 0.22) for pneumonia. This shows no statistical difference in infection rate between the two treatments. Conclusions: The increase in incidence rate of hospitalizations of 0.23 events/person-years among the abiraterone group, despite greater age and comorbidities in the enzalutamide group, suggests an increased risk of adverse events requiring hospitalization in patients started on abiraterone initially. However, no difference was seen in incidence of the three most common infections between cohorts. This suggests that the difference in mechanism of action and use of prednisone with AA may not be of clinical significance with regards to risk for infection.',\n",

       "  '93Background: M9241 is an immunocytokine that targets single- and double-stranded DNA which allows the treatment to localize IL-12 to necrotic tumor (Xu, CCR 2017). M9241 was well-tolerated as a monotherapy in a Phase I study with solid tumors (Strauss J, CCR 2019). Additional preclinical data has demonstrated synergy of M9241 with cytotoxic therapy. This is the first study to examine the safety of a novel combination of chemotherapy and immunocytokines in metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: This safety analysis included patients with mCSPC or mCRPC. Patients were enrolled in a 2-dose level (DL) escalation cohort of M9241 (DL 1: 12mcg/kg, DL 2: 16.8mcg/kg) combined with docetaxel (75mg/m2) with 6 patients planned per DL. A third DL of 8mcg/kg will enroll 6 more patients after the 16.8mcg/kg DL has fully enrolled. All patients were treated with ADT. Patients were initiated on treatment with docetaxel with a plan for mCSPC patients to receive six 3-week cycles of combined treatment and mCRPC patients to continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity. M9241 was given starting with the second cycle of treatment for each patient. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 6 weeks after start of docetaxel (from cycle 1 day 1 through the end of the first cycle with M9241). Results: The study has enrolled 10 patients out of a planned 18 for the safety portion. Age range is 58-82 with a median of 69 years. Race distribution is 80% White and 20% Black. Gleason scores for patients were 8 (40%), 9 (40%), and 10 (20%). No DLTs were seen with either dose-level. Only 1 patient had a Grade 4 AE, neutropenia. Grade 3 toxicities included anemia, diarrhea, leukopenia, and hypotension (each occurring in 10% of the patients). The most frequent adverse events (AEs) of any grade were anemia (40%) and lymphopenia (40%), followed by fatigue (30%), diarrhea (20%), and fever (20%). Conclusions: We established a safe dose-level of M9241 at ≥ 12mcg/kg. Updated clinical data from the safety cohort (n = 18) will be presented. This demonstrates that an immunocytokine and chemotherapy can be safely combined for treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. A planned expansion cohort will evaluate docetaxel and M9241 in mCRPC.

       "  '94Background: CART-PSMA-02 is a multi-center, open-label, phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN T-cells (PSMA-CART) in patients (pts) with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PSMA-CART are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor with specificity to PSMA and a dominant negative form of TGFβRII which renders PSMA-CART resistant to TGFβ-mediated immunosuppression. Herein, preliminary safety and efficacy results from this trial are reported. Methods: This is a 3+3 dose escalation study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of PSMA-CART cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LD) with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Results: As of October 2021, 9 pts were dosed. Two pts received 1-3x107 cells, 4 pts received 1-3x108 cells, and 3 pts received 0.7-1x108 cells with anakinra prophylaxis. Grade 1-2 CRS was observed in all pts receiving 1-3x108 cells and 2/3 pts who received anakinra prophylaxis. No pts developed CRS > G2. Two events of immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed (1 G2, 1 G5). Two pts experienced DLTs at dose level of 1-3x108, one of whom developed G5 events of ICANS and multi-organ failure (MOF) after receiving 30% of his fractionated dose (total dose = 0.9x108). This pt’s clinical course and autopsy findings were consistent with macrophage activation syndrome. The trial continued with a modified dose of 0.7-1x108 and the incorporation of prophylactic anakinra (100mg SC daily x7 doses). Another G5 event was observed, likely related to immune toxicity, with ferritin levels peaking at >100,000 ng/mL prior to death. Cause of death on autopsy was equivocal and contributing factors included metastatic prostate cancer, MOF and coagulopathy. Cytokine levels from both pts experiencing G5 events were elevated compared to all other pts (e.g., IL-6, sIL2RA, MIG/CXCL9, MIP1b/CCL4, IP-10/CXCL19, IL2 and IL1b). In pts receiving ≥ 0.9x108 cells (n=7), preliminary efficacy results demonstrated stable disease by RECIST v1.1 at day 28 (D28) in 4/5 evaluable pts. Decreases in serum PSA occurred in 4/7 pts with >50% decreases observed in 2/5 evaluable pts at D28. Conclusions: PSMA-CART has shown preliminary evidence of biological activity in the absence of clear indications of on-target/off-tumor toxicity. The exact mechanisms driving the severe immune-mediated toxicities in this study are currently unclear. While this study has been closed to further enrollment, ongoing research efforts are aimed at exploring patient specific factors, tumor microenvironment factors, and the PSMA-CART construct (including both functional components and armored modules) to design future constructs of PSMA-CART that will enhance the efficacy/safety profile and allow for continued study of this novel therapy in the clinic.

       "  '95 Background: mCRPC remains an incurable disease with unmet need for improved therapies. PARP inhibition has demonstrated antitumor activity, and preclinical studies suggest synergy between PARP and AKT inhibition. This phase Ib trial (NCT03840200) sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PARP inhibitor rucaparib (ruca) with AKT inhibitor ipatasertib (ipat) and explore early safety and efficacy in patients (pts) with mCRPC. Methods: The study had 2 parts: a part 1 dose-escalation phase (cohort [C]1: ipat 300 mg QD + ruca 400 mg BID; C2a: ipat 300 mg QD + ruca 600 mg BID; C2b ipat 400 mg QD + ruca 400 mg BID; C3: ipat 400 mg QD + ruca 600 mg BID) in unselected pts with mCRPC or advanced breast or ovarian cancer, and a Part 2 dose-expansion phase in pts with mCRPC whose previous androgen deprivation therapy failed. The primary safety endpoints were AEs and dose-limiting toxicities, with the goal of identifying a recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The primary efficacy endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (PSA reduction of ≥ 50%) in pts with mCRPC. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ORR per RECIST 1.1, radiographic PFS (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 and OS in pts with mCRPC. We assessed homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN status and otheralterations by next-generation sequencing. Results: Part 1 enrolled 21 pts: 17 with mCRPC, 3 with ovarian cancer and 1 with breast cancer (C1 [n=8], C2a [n=6] and C2b [n=7], C3 [not opened]). Ipat 400 mg QD + ruca 400 mg BID was the selected RP2D. 30 pts enrolled in Part 2, so 37 pts with mCRPC (C2b + Part 2) received the RP2D (median follow-up 93 days). All grade AEs occurred in 37 pts (100%), serious AEs in 8 pts (22%) and AEs leading to treatment modification in 26 pts (70%). The most frequent AEs (all grade and grade 3, respectively) were diarrhea (35 [95%] and 2 [5%]); asthenia (24 [65%] and 4 [11%]); and nausea (24 [65%] and 2 [5%]). There was 1 grade 4 AE (anemia) and no grade 5 AEs. See the table for efficacy data. In biomarker subgroups, the PSA response rate was 50% (3/6) in pts with HRD tumors vs 25% (4/16) in pts with HR-proficient tumors, and 14% (1/7) vs 40% (6/15) in pts with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN–altered or intact tumors, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of ipat and ruca was well tolerated but did not show clinically relevant antitumor activity in pts with mCRPC, including in predefined biomarker subpopulations.

       "  '96Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) targeted to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a new targeted treatment for progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PSMA-RLT conjugates a radionuclide to a small molecule ligand with affinity for PSMA. Recent trials, such as TheraP and VISION, established improvements in progression free survival, overall survival, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for PSMA-RLT. Less is known about the impact of PSMA-RLT on symptoms related to bone metastasis (BM), commonly causing significant morbidity in men with mCRPC. The optimal tools for PRO collection with PSMA-RLT are also uncertain. We previously reported improvements in Brief Pain Inventory and now report EORTC QLQ-BM22 data to describe change in symptoms related to bone metastasis among men receiving PSMA-RLT for mCRPC. Methods: From 2015 to 2017, 50 patients received up to 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 every 6 weeks (trial registration: ACTRN12615000912583). Patients completed a validated assessment of bone metastasis-related pain (EORTC QLQ-BM22) prior to each cycle and 6 or 12 weeks after the last cycle of 177Lu-PSMA. Change in pain over the course of the study was examined using linear mixed effects models. We also examined whether unadjusted changes in PROs exceeded published cutoffs for minimal clinically important difference scores. Results: Patients reported reduced bone metastasis-related pain at various sites over time (p =.01). Of 44 patients completing this scale before cycle 2, 22 (50%) reported clinically significant improvement in pain at various sites. At follow-up, of the 37 patients alive, 25 provided evaluable data on bone metastasis-related pain. Of these, 10 (40%) reported clinically significant improvement in pain at various sites. Patients also reported less functional interference from pain over time (p  <.01) and lower consistency, intermittency, and difficulty alleviating pain with medication over time (p =.01). Before cycle 2 and at follow-up, 26% and 38% of respondents reported clinically significant reduction in functional interference from pain. Before cycle 2 and at follow-up, 33% and 42% of respondents reported clinically significant improvement in consistency, intermittency, and difficulty alleviating pain with medication. Conclusions: 177Lu-PSMA RLT resulted in improvements in bone metastasis-related symptoms, supporting prior findings using other PRO measures. At follow-up, 38-42% of patients completing PRO assessment reported clinically meaningful improvements in bone metastasis-related pain, a significant contributor to quality of life.

       "  '97Background: The phase 3 VISION trial (NCT03511664) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the radioligand [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (177Lu-PSMA-617) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus protocol-permitted standard of care (SOC) significantly improved overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival of patients compared with SOC alone. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or above was higher with 177Lu-PSMA-617 than without, but quality of life was not adversely affected. This dosimetry sub-study aimed to quantify the absorbed dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in organs at risk of radiotoxicity due to exposure levels or radiosensitivity. Methods: In a sub-study of VISION, dosimetry was performed in a separate cohort of 29 non-randomized participants at four German sites. Eligible patients received 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq per cycle) plus SOC every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients underwent planar whole-body scintigraphy scans and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scans of the upper and lower abdomen at 2, 24, 48 and 168 hours after first administration. Blood and urine samples were collected throughout cycle 1. 177Lu-PSMA-617 dosimetry outcomes were based on biodistribution, assessed using whole-body conjugate planar-image data, SPECT/CT image data, blood assay data and urinary excretion data. Radiation exposure was estimated using Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling (OLINDA/EXM) software code version 2.2. Results were expressed as absorbed dose per unit activity (Gy/GBq) and cumulative estimated absorbed dose (Gy) over all 6 cycles (44.4 GBq cumulative activity) extrapolated from cycle 1 data. Results: Radiation-absorbed doses per unit activity were highest in the lacrimal glands, followed by the salivary glands, with mean values of 2.1 Gy/GBq (standard deviation [SD], 0.47) and 0.63 Gy/GBq (0.36), respectively. The kidneys received 0.43 Gy/GBq (SD, 0.16) and the blood-based red marrow dose was 0.035 Gy/GBq (0.02). The 6-cycle cumulative estimated absorbed dose was 92 Gy (SD, 21) in the lacrimal glands, 28 Gy (16) in the salivary glands, 19 Gy (7.3) in the kidneys and 1.5 Gy (0.90) in the red marrow. In cycle 1, 20% of patients had at least one hematological AE of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 2; no patient experienced any renal AE of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 or any lacrimal gland toxicity, and 2 patients had a grade 1 salivary gland AE. Conclusions: 177Lu-PSMA-617 dosimetry results in this sub-study were consistent with the published ranges, and cycle 1 AEs affecting at-risk organs were infrequent and of low-to-moderate severity. These findings indicate that patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617 should be at low risk of radiation-induced AEs.

       "  '98Background: P-PSMA-101 is an autologous CAR-T therapy targeting PSMA, with a high percentage of stem cell memory T cells (TSCM) associated with efficacy, safety, and bone homing (particularly relevant to prostate cancer). It is manufactured using a novel non-viral transposon system (piggyBac) that creates high TSCM products. Genes are inserted encoding a PSMA-targeted Centyrin CAR, iCasp9-based safety switch, and DHFR to purify CAR-T cells. P-PSMA-101 completely eliminated tumors in intractable murine models of prostate cancer, providing rationale for this phase 1 trial (NCT04249947). Methods: Patients with mCRPC treated with or not eligible for a CYP17 inhibitor or second-generation antiandrogen, and a taxane were enrolled. P-PSMA-101 was manufactured from apheresed T cells and administered IV following a standard 3-day cy/flu lymphodepletion regimen. Dose escalation from 0.25-15 x 106 cells/kg is planned. Results: As of September 30, 2021, P-PSMA-101 had been administered to 10 heavily pretreated patients (median 7 prior regimens; range 3-15). Single infusions of 0.25 (n=5) to 0.75 (n=5) x 106 cells/kg have been assessed, with dose escalation continuing. P-PSMA-101 cells were shown to expand in blood via qPCR assay, peaking 2-3 weeks after infusion, consistent with the high percentage of TSCM. Significant antitumor responses were seen in this preliminary data set. Declines in PSA were seen in 7 patients (>50% in 3 and >99% in 1). Of 4 patients who had pre- and post-treatment FDG and PSMA-PET imaging, 3 demonstrated marked to complete resolution of abnormal uptake at known metastatic disease sites, with concordance in bone and CT scans, and/or circulating tumor cells (CTC). In 1 case, post-treatment tumor biopsy demonstrated infiltration by P-PSMA-101 CAR-T cells and elimination of tumor cells (pathologic complete response). Safety was consistent with expectations for a CAR-T product. CRS was seen in 60% (10% Gr ≥3) of patients. DLT was seen in 1 patient with macrophage activation syndrome/uveitis, and was the only Gr ≥3 CRS event. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) has not occurred. CRS marker elevations were modest (max IL-6: 642.6 pg/mL). The most common AEs were cytopenias, infections, and constitutional symptoms (Gr ≥3 60%, 10%, and 0%), as expected with lymphodepletion. Treatable related ocular AEs were noted in 3 patients. Conclusions: These results parallel preclinical findings that P-PSMA-101 can produce marked efficacy in mCRPC, and very low doses are highly efficacious, consistent with unique product attributes such as the TSCM phenotype and bone tropism. This is the first report demonstrating profound antitumor effects of a novel PSMA-directed CAR-T-cell platform with concordant biochemical, radiographic, and pathologic parameters, demonstrating that therapeutic benefit of unarmored CAR-T cells in a major solid tumor is possible.

       "  '99Background: To investigate a clinical response of GnRH antagonist monotherapy against CAB therapy for mHSPC. Methods: Histopathological confirmed mHSPC patients were randomly assigned to GnRH antagonist monotherapy group (Group A) and CAB group (Group B). A deferred CAB therapy by adding bicalutamide to GnRH antagonist was performed in Group A after PSA progression. The primary endpoint was PSA progression free survival (PSA-PFS). The secondary endpoints were time to CAB treatment failure (CAB-TTF), radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), change of PSA, effect on hormone dynamics, change of bone metabolic markers, effect on lipid metabolism, adverse events (AE). This trial was registered with UMIN-CTR (UMIN000014243). Results: A total of 200 patients (101 patients in Group A and 99 in Group B) were registered from June 2014 to June 2017. The PSA-PFS was significantly better in Group B (HR (95% CI) =1.40 (1.01-1.95), p=0.041) as shown in the table. Time to CAB treatment failure (TTF) tended to be better in Group A, but there was no statistically significant difference in CAB-TTF between two groups (Table). rPFS and OS were also not statistically significant difference (Table). Time to PSA nadir was significantly shorter in Group B (HR (95% CI) = 0.72 (0.54 - 0.97), p = 0.028). The proportion of patients whose serum testosterone did not reach or maintain the castration level was more frequent in Group A (significant difference at 60 weeks, p = 0.046). There was no significant difference in the effect of bone metabolic markers and lipid metabolism between two groups. In terms of AE, injection-site-reaction was more frequent in Group A. Conclusions: LH-RH agonist CAB therapy (Group B) prolonged PSA-PFS compared to LH-RH antagonist monotherapy (Group A), probably due to the higher frequency of insufficient achievement of castration level in Group A. However, a deferred CAB therapy by adding bicalutamide to GnRH antagonist resulted in no difference in CAB-TTF, rPFS and OS.

       "  '100Background: ARTO (NCT03449719) is a multicentre, randomized trial started in January 2019 and currently running in 16 Italian centres, testing the benefit of adding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to Abiraterone Acetate (AA) in oligometastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) patients. Seventy-nine per cent of the target accrual population has been currently enrolled. Here we present a report about early efficacy results of SBRT+AA combination. Methods: Data from patients with ≥ 6 months of follow up were reported. All patients were affected by oligometastatic CRPC, defined as ≤ 3 non-visceral metastatic lesions. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either AA alone (control arm) or associated with concomitant SBRT on all sites of disease (treatment arm). Primary endpoint of the trial is rate of biochemical response (BR, defined as a PSA decrease ≥ 50% from baseline measured within 6 months from treatment start). Complete biochemical response (CBR, defined as PSA at 6 months ≤ 0.2 ng/ml) is a secondary endpoint of the trial. Results: Overall, 123 patients have been currently enrolled in ARTO trial. To date, 98 patients had ≥ 6 months of follow-up and were evaluable for the present analysis. BR was detected in 75 (76.5%) patients (82.2% vs. 71.7% in treatment vs. control arm, respectively), with an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) equal to 1.83 (95% CI 0.69-4.82, p-value 0.22). After adjustment for baseline PSA and the number of metastatic sites ( > 1 vs. 1), the OR for BR was 2.23 (95% CI 0.74-6.73, p-value 0.15). CBR was detected in 36 (36.7%) patients (46.7% vs. 28.3% in treatment vs. control arm, respectively), with an unadjusted OR of 2.22 (95% CI 0.96-5.12, p-value 0.06), and an adjusted OR of 2.31 (95% CI 0.90-5.92, p-value 0.08). In multivariable models, baseline PSA and the number of metastatic sites > 1 were non-statistically associated with CBR, with OR equal to 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-1.01, p-value 0.06) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.46-3.09, p-value 0.71), respectively. Conclusions: Results showed promising efficacy of SBRT+AA combination if compared to systemic treatment alone for oligometastatic CRPC, OR for BR and CBR were doubled in treatment vs. control arm, even if statistical significance is not yet reached. Interestingly, baseline burden of disease seems to predict increased outcome after SBRT, suggesting that selection criteria for local treatment may be further refined. Complete results for primary endpoint are awaited in 2022, after enrollment and follow-up completion of whole cohort, and may confirm these early outcomes in a larger population.

       "  '101Background: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of death in prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer are likely to have CV risk factors and CV-related concomitant medications. In the phase 3 HERO study, a 54% lower incidence of major adverse cardiac events was reported in men treated with the oral GnRH receptor antagonist relugolix vs leuprolide. Herein, we characterize the impact of concomitant CV therapies on efficacy and safety in the HERO study. Methods: In HERO, 930 men with advanced prostate cancer were randomized 2:1 and treated with relugolix (120 mg orally once daily [after single 360 mg loading dose] or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. Subgroups analyzed included men who received antihypertensives, antithrombotics, or lipid-modifying therapies, as well as the most common drug classes (>10%) and single most common agent within each class. Assessments included sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng/dL) through 48 weeks and safety parameters (adverse events). Results: Antihypertensives, antithrombotics, and lipid modifying agents were utilized by 52.7%, 39.1%, and 39.6% of men in the HERO trial, respectively (table). In the main subgroups, point estimates for sustained castration rates were consistent with the overall estimates of relugolix and leuprolide observed in the overall population (table). Sustained castration rates were also consistent for men taking the most common drug classes (table) and individual agents in each class (losartan [n=103]: relugolix, 95.4% vs. leuprolide, 80.6%; amlodipine [n=229]: 97.2% vs. 85.5%; metoprolol [n=88]: 95.7% vs. 86.9%; acetylsalicylic acid [n=259]: 97.0% vs. 92.1%; clopidogrel [n=43]: 96.4% vs. 86.7%; simvastatin [n=78]: 98.0% vs. 87.3%). Incidence and types of adverse events were similar among men who received antihypertensives, antithrombotics, and lipid modifying agents during the trial. Conclusions: In the HERO trial, relugolix suppressed testosterone and was generally well tolerated when given with concomitant CV agents, with results consistent with those of the overall population.

       "  '102Background: The LATITUDE (NCT01715285) trial established the survival benefit of abiraterone (AA) over placebo (PBO) in combination with ADT as first-line therapy in high-risk mHSPC patients. By PCWG3 guidelines, pts with PSA progression and no clinical or radiographic progression should not discontinue therapy. We aimed to evaluate the proportion of patients experiencing PSA progression only in the LATITUDE trial and its prognostic significance. Methods: We performed a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of pts treated in the LATITUDE trial (YODA project #2020-4298). Confirmed PSA progression (PSAProg) and radiographic progression (RadProg) were defined by PCWG2 criteria. Patients with PSA progression with a coinciding radiographic evaluation showing no radiographic progression were defined as progressing by PSA only. In these patients, time from PSA to radiographic progression was defined as the time (months) from the date of confirmed PSAProg to the date of RadProg. Kaplan-meier and Cox models were used to define median survival times and comparison of outcomes in the AA vs PBO groups. Results: 771 patients (63.7%) experienced PSAProg; AA: 302 pts (49.9%); PBO: 469 pts (77.6%). In 501 pts (64.5%) there was no RadProg on the coinciding radiographic evaluation (PSA only progression), 187 (61.9%) in the AA and 314 (67%) in the PBO arm (p = 0.153). 207 (41.3%) pts had measurable disease at baseline, a similar proportion to that in the overall study population (43.8%). 315 (62.9%) of pts with PSA progression only developed subsequent radiographic progression, 105 (56.1%) in the AA and 210 (66.9%) in the PBO arm (p = 0.017). Median time from PSAProg to RadProg was 8.4 months (95%CI: 8.1-9.2); no significant difference was observed in pts in the AA vs PBO arm (9.2 vs 8.3 months; HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.7-1.1]; p = 0.287). Median OS from the time of PSAProg was 19.8 months (95%CI:17.2-24) in AA-treated pts. OS from time to PSAProg was longer in AA-treated pts with PSAonly progression than those with simultaneous PSAProg & RadProg (24 vs 15.3 months; HR: 0.62; p = 0.007). Conclusions: A significant proportion of high-risk mHSPC patients experience a PSA rise as the only initial feature of disease progression. In these patients, there appears to be no significant difference in time from PSA to radiographic progression in AA vs PBO treated-patients. These results highlight the need to ensure an appropriate follow-up in pts progressing by PSA, in order to identify radiographic or clinical progression and initiate subsequent therapy early, thereby maximizing benefit from the treatment sequence.',\n",

       "  '103Background: Prostate cancer with CDK12 inactivation represents a distinct subtype in mCRPC, tumors are characterized by excessive tandem duplications, genomic instability, gene fusion-caused putative neoantigens and increased tumor T cell infiltration. Retrospective experiences with ICI in CDK12 inactivation CRPC pts reported PSA and radiographic responses. We conducted a prospective multi-site clinical trial of ipilimumab and nivolumab in CDK12 inactivation or mutated cancers. Herein, we report our findings in the completed cohort A of men with mCPRC. Methods: Eligible pts had mCRPC (ongoing androgen deprivation therapy with serum testosterone £ 50 ng/dL) and putative CDK12 inactivation of function aberrations on any commercial or institutional CLIA/CAP approved next generation sequencing assay. Archival tumor tissue was requested for correlative biomarker analysis. Pts received nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV q3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab at 480 mg IV q4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoint was PSA response, defined as a greater than or equal to 50% decline in PSA from baseline. Secondary endpoints included safety/toxicity, secondary efficacy measures including QoL and overall survival. Exploratory objectives included baseline tumor whole exome analysis and changes in circulating immune profiles with therapy. Results: As of data cut-off in Aug 2021, 28 mCRPC pts enrolled in Cohort A; median ECOG PS was 1 (0-2 range), 22/28 had Gleason 8-10 cancer, mean baseline PSA at study entry was 231 ng/dL, all pts had received ≥1 prior oral androgen signaling inhibitor and ≥1 cytotoxic chemotherapy. Unconfirmed PSA ≥30% decline was seen in 6/28 pts (21.4%) and PSA ≥50% decline in 4/28 pts (14.2%). Grade ≥3 possible/probable/definite adverse events were noted in 7/28 (25%) and SAEs in 10/28 pts (35.7%). Six pts (21.4%) experienced a rapid PSA increase by ≥ 10-fold over baseline. Conclusions: Combination immunotherapy was reasonably tolerated in this heavily pre-treated population and was associated with unconfirmed PSA responses in a subset of pts. Ongoing correlative analyses could explain responses mechanistically. Enrollment in Cohort B of non-prostate cancers and Cohort C of nivolumab monotherapy in prostate cancer are still ongoing.

       "  '104Background: In the phase 3 HERO study, the oral GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix, showed sustained testosterone suppression superior to that of leuprolide (96.7% vs 88.8%; difference: 7.9% [95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8; P < 0.001]). Herein, we provide an analysis of the testosterone recovery data in a subgroup of 184 men from the HERO study who were not indicated to continue androgen deprivation therapy. Methods: The phase 3 HERO study was designed to evaluate relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer. Overall, 934 men were randomized 2:1 to receive relugolix 120 mg orally once daily after a single oral loading dose of relugolix 360 mg on Day 1 or leuprolide injections every 12 weeks for 48 weeks. Testosterone recovery was assessed in 184 patients who completed 48 weeks of treatment and who did not plan to start alternative androgen deprivation therapy within the following 12 weeks (or within 24 weeks following the last injection of leuprolide 3-month depot). During the 90-day recovery period, assessments included time to testosterone recovery (≥ 280 ng/dL, the lower limit of the normal range) using the Kaplan-Meier method, PSA concentrations in testosterone recovery phase, and adverse events during the recovery phase. All analyses were conducted in a modified intent to treat population. Results: Overall, 137 men in the relugolix group and 47 men in the leuprolide group were included in these analyses. Mean (standard deviation) testosterone levels for men entering the recovery assessment were 427±142 ng/dL and 404±127 ng/dL in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate of testosterone recovery to ≥280 ng/dL at 90 days after drug discontinuation was 53.9% in the relugolix group compared with 3.2% in the leuprolide group (nominal p = 0.0017). Overall, 74 of the 137 men in relugolix group recovered testosterone with a median time to recovery of 86.0 days (95% CI: 65.0, 92.0), versus 2 of the 47 men in leuprolide group with a median time to recovery of 112.0 days (95% CI: 112.0, not estimable). At the 90-day follow-up visit, the median PSA values were 0.39 ng/mL (range: 0 to 233.1) and 0.06 ng/mL (0 to 14.0) in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively. Incidence of adverse events were generally similar in the treatment groups during the recovery phase, with 96% of men experiencing at least one adverse event and 15% of men experiencing a grade ≥3 adverse event in both treatment groups during the recovery phase. Conclusions: Relugolix, an oral nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist, had a faster and more complete recovery of testosterone to normal levels after treatment discontinuation versus leuprolide in a subgroup of men from the phase 3 HERO study.

       "  '105Background: Prostate cancer disproportionately impacts Black men, with a higher incidence and worse outcomes relative to other races (Siegel DA, MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020;69:1473). In the international phase 3 HERO study, relugolix, the once-daily oral GnRH receptor antagonist, demonstrated superior continuous suppression of testosterone to castrate levels through week 48 compared to leuprolide (96.7% for relugolix vs. 88.8% of men receiving leuprolide; Shore N, NEJM 2020; 382:2187) in men with advanced prostate cancer (APC). To further characterize the results from this trial in black men a subgroup analysis of HERO was undertaken. Methods: HERO was a phase 3 randomized, open-label, study to evaluate relugolix vs. leuprolide in 930 treated men with APC. The subgroup analyzed included all Black men enrolled in the HERO study. Assessments analyzed included sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng/dL) from day 29 through 48 weeks, early testosterone suppression to castrate levels (day 4 and day 15), PSA response (>50% decrease) at day 15 with confirmation at day 29, profound castration rate (<20 ng/dL) at day 15, and FSH level at the end of week 24. Results: Of the 930 men (relugolix: 622; leuprolide: 308) randomized and treated in HERO, 30 (4.8%) and 16 (5.2%) Black men were enrolled in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively. Most men in this subgroup were from North America (82.6%) and ≤75 years old (89.1%), with a median age of 66 years. More Black men in the relugolix group had metastatic disease at study entry (30% vs. 25%), prior androgen deprivation therapy (13.3% vs. 6.3%), and prior prostatectomy (53.3% vs. 18.8%). Median PSA (12.8 vs. 16.0 ng/ml) and median testosterone levels (375.2 vs. 419.2 ng/dL) were lower at baseline for relugolix vs leuprolide. Of the Black men who received relugolix, 93.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.9% to 98.3%) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 93.3% (95% CI, 61.3 to 99.0) of men receiving leuprolide (difference: 0% [95% CI, -15.5% to 15.5]). Testosterone suppression to castrate levels at day 4 (53% vs 0%), castrate levels at day 15 (97% vs 13%), and profound castration rates on day 15 (67% vs 6%) were greater with relugolix vs leuprolide. PSA response at day 15 was 83.3% with relugolix and 6.3% with leuprolide. At the end of week 24, median FSH levels were 1.75 IU/L for relugolix and 3.72 IU/L for leuprolide. Incidence of all grade adverse events were 96.7% vs 87.5% and grade ≥3 adverse events were 16.7% vs 25.0% in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively. Conclusions: In this HERO study subgroup analysis, relugolix was effective and generally well tolerated in a cohort of Black men, consistent with the relugolix results in the overall population. Given the limited size of the subgroup, additional research is warranted in this population. Clinical trial information: NCT03085095.',\n",

       "  '106Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET) allows detection of small and/or atypically localized metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) lesions. In a subset of patients with recurrent oligometastatic PCa salvage surgery with PSMA-targeted radioguidance (PSMA-RGS) may be of value. We aimed to evaluate the oncological outcomes of salvage PSMA-RGS for oligorecurrent PCa and determine predictive preoperative factors of improved outcomes. Methods: In this cohort study within two tertiary care centers, patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) and imaging with PSMA PET receiving salvage PSMA-RGS between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for various parameters were used to test for BCR-free survival (BFS) and therapy-free survival (TFS) differences. Postoperative complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo. Results: Overall, 364 patients were assessed. At PSMA-RGS, median (IQR) age and preoperative PSA was 67 (61-71) years and 1.0 (0.5-1.9) ng/ml. Metastatic soft-tissue lesions were removed in 356 (94.4%) patients. Within three months from surgery, 25 (6.6%) patients suffered from Clavien-Dindo complications grade III-IV. During follow-up, 235 patients experienced BCR and 129 patients received further therapy. Median follow-up for patients who did not experience BCR and who did not receive further therapy was 11.1 months and 10.5 months, respectively. Median (IQR) BFS and TFS was 7.8 (5.4-10.9) and 34.9 (24.7-43.5) months. At two years of follow-up, BFS rate was 31.9% and TFS rate was 56.6%. In multivariable analyses, higher preoperative PSA (HR: 1.06), higher number of PSMA-avid lesions on preoperative imaging (HR: 1.2) and multiple (pelvic plus retroperitoneal) localizations (HR: 1.7), as well as retroperitoneal localization (HR: 2.0) of lesions in PSMA PET imaging were independent predictors of BCR after PSMA-RGS. Limitations are the retrospective design and lack of a control group. Conclusions: As salvage surgery in oligorecurrent PCa currently constitutes an experimental treatment approach careful patient selection is mandatory based on life expectancy, low PSA values and low number of PSMA PET avid lesions located in the pelvis. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and define the oncological value of salvage surgical procedures in oligorecurrent PCa.',\n",

       "  '107Background: In patients (pts) with high-volume (HV) metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) the addition of six cycles of docetaxel (TXT) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE trials prolonged survival by 10-18 months (mo). Aim of our study was to evaluate the principal patterns of relapse after TXT and their clinical and prognostic significance. Methods: We conducted a multicentric (14 Italian Centers), prospective, observational study enrolling HV mCSPC patients treated with ADT plus early TXT. Clinical and pathological features were recorded. Time to castration resistance (TCR) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The Chi-Square test, t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used to assess difference between the groups as appropriate. Results: We identified 166 de novo mCSPC pts, with a median age of 64 years (range 38-84). The most common metastatic sites at diagnosis were: bone (93%) and lymph nodes (81%); visceral disease (lung and liver) was present in 36% of cases. 87% of pts had good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (0-1), the median baseline PSA was 359 ng/ml (range 2.64-5800) and 43% experienced cancer pain. 87% of 158 evaluable pts had a Grade Group (GG) ³4. The majority of pts (81%) completed six cycles of TXT. The median time to PSA nadir was 10.2 months (mo), PSA response > 50% was achieved in 96% of pts and the most common best response reported was partial response (58%). At the time of this analysis, 122 pts (67%) had biochemical or radiographic progressive disease (PD) to TXT and 67 of these (60%) developing new metastatic sites (NMS). No differences with respect of main clinical features was found between NMS pts and nonNMS, with the exception of GG (96% of NMS pts had GG 4-5 vs 74% of nonNMS; p = 0.002). In NMS group we found a higher rate of nodal PD (52% vs 22%, p = 0.001) and higher rate of bone PD (73% vs 47%, p = 0.005) compared to nonNMS. No differences in the rate of visceral PD. With a median follow-up of 27.9 mo, the median TCR was 14.3 mo (95%CI 12.8-16.7), without significant differences between NMS and nonNMS groups. About 90% of progressed pts received first-line treatment for mCRPC disease with similar outcomes. The median OS was 41.8 mo for the overall population, with not significant differences between NMS and nonNMS groups (22 mo and 25 mo). Overall, median OS from mCRPC diagnosis was 19.6 mo, similar in NMS and no-NMS pts (10 mo and 12 mo). Conclusions: In progressive mCSPC pts receiving early TXT, we observed more frequently the development of NMS with an elevated GG and a trophism for bone and lymph nodes.

       "  '108Background: The AKT pathway is frequently deregulated in mCRPC. ProCAID tested addition of capivasertib, a potent selective inhibitor of all three AKT isoforms (AKT1/2/3) to docetaxel chemotherapy vs. placebo plus docetaxel for mCRPC. The primary analysis showed no difference between treatment arms for the primary endpoint of composite progression free survival (cPFS). However, OS, which was a secondary endpoint, was extended in the capivasertib plus docetaxel arm. cPFS and OS results were consistent irrespective of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway biomarker status (Crabb et\\xa0al, J Clin Oncol 2021;39(3):190-201). Methods: An updated analysis of mature OS data was undertaken once events reached ≥65% by Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for minimisation factors, within the intent to treat (ITT) population (n = 150). Patients (pts) and investigators remained blinded to treatment allocation. We also investigated OS outcomes within subsets based on prior androgen receptor targeted agent (ARTA) exposure to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (abi/enza) and the balance of post-trial life extending treatment use by treatment arm. Funding: Cancer Research UK (C9317/A16029, CRUK/12/042) and AstraZeneca. Results: At this OS update, 99 pts (66.0%) had died, with 88 of these deaths (88.9%) due to prostate cancer. 5 pts (3.3%) remained on capivasertib or placebo. Median OS was 25.3 months for the capivasertib plus docetaxel arm vs. 20.3 months for placebo plus docetaxel (hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.05; nominal p = 0.09). One, or more, subsequent life extending treatment options, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223 and cabazitaxel, were received by 99 pts (66.0%) and were balanced between treatment arms (68% capivasertib, 64% placebo). 101 pts (67.3%; 51 capivasertib, 50 placebo) had received abi/enza prior to entering ProCAID. Within this subgroup, OS benefit for capivasertib plus docetaxel (median OS 31.1 months) was maintained vs. placebo plus docetaxel (median OS 19.3 months; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.91), but not in the remaining 49 pts who were naive to prior abi/enza (median OS 31.1 vs. not reached respectively; HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.23). These updated OS results remained consistent irrespective of biomarker status for PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway activation. No clinically significant differences from the previously reported safety outcomes were seen with extended follow up of this trial. Conclusions: OS remains longer within the ProCAID ITT population with the addition of capivasertib to docetaxel for mCRPC. This does not appear to be explained by subsequent treatment choices. Exploratory analysis found prolonged OS with capivasertib within a subset of pts previously exposed to an ARTA which should be evaluated in prospective trials.

       "  '109Background: Radiopharmaceuticals, including Ga-68-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11, F-18-fluciclovine, and choline C-11, are increasingly used to stage and inform therapies for PCa. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to PET-detected oligometastatic PCa has been shown to improve progression free survival (PFS) compared to observation. However, for men who subsequently develop oligorecurrent disease, outcomes following second SBRT are unknown. Methods: A retrospective, single-center, cohort study was conducted. Pts were identified through electronic health records. Inclusion criteria included pts with oligometastatic (1-5 lesions) PCa detected on PSMA, fluciclovine, or choline C-11 PET who underwent 2 consecutive courses of SBRT to tracer-avid oligometastatic disease between 7/2013 and 7/2021. Exclusion criteria included presence of visceral metastases and pure small cell neuroendocrine PCa. Data on stage, tracer type, concurrent systemic therapy, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses for first SBRT (SBRT1) and second SBRT (SBRT2) were collected. Outcomes included PSA decline of ≥50% (PSA50), ≥90% (PSA90), and PSA-PFS. SBRT2 outcomes were compared based on change of concurrent systemic therapy with SBRT2 (e.g., addition of abiraterone or anti-androgen withdrawal) and PSA50 to SBRT1 using Fisher’s exact text and Wilcoxon rank sum test, respectively. Results: A total of 12 pts met eligibility criteria. At SBRT1, 10 (83%) pts had hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) and 2 (17%) had castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). For PET tracers, 7 (58%) used PSMA, 4 (33%) fluciclovine, and 1 (8%) choline. After SBRT1, 12 pts (100%) had a PSA decline, 8 (67%) had a PSA50 response, and 6 (50%) a PSA90 response. Median PSA PFS after SBRT1 was 30mo (95%CI 9-65mo). Six (50%) SBRT1 pts had a concurrent change in systemic therapy. At SBRT2, 8 (67%) pts had HSPC and 4 (33%) had CRPC; 7 (58%) used PSMA and 5 (42%) fluciclovine. After SBRT2, 12 (100%) pts had a PSA decline, 8 (67%) had a PSA50 response, and 8 (67%) a PSA90 response. After SBRT2, median PSA PFS was 23mo (95%CI 12-35mo). Among 7 pts who had a concurrent change in systemic therapy with SBRT2, all (100%) had a PSA50 response; among 5 who did not (4 of whom did not receive any systemic therapy), 1 (20%) had a PSA50 response (P=0.01). Among 8 pts who had a PSA50 response to SBRT1, 7 (88%) had one to SBRT2; among 4 who did not have a PSA50 response to SBRT1, 1 (25%) had one to SBRT2 (P=0.01). No complications related to SBRT were documented. Conclusions: Serial SBRT for oligometastatic PCa detected on fluciclovine, PSMA, or choline PET is feasible and can achieve PSA declines independent of systemic therapy. PSA responses were greater when systemic therapy was changed. This preliminary evidence of benefit, based on PSA responses and PSA PFS, provides rationale for larger, prospective studies of serial SBRT for oligometastatic PCa.',\n",

       "  '110Background: Sabizabulin is a novel oral cytoskeleton disruptor being developed for use in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A phase 1b/2 clinical study was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the preliminary efficacy in men with mCRPC resistant to androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTAs). Methods: The phase 1b portion of the study in 39 men utilized escalating and expanding dose and duration. The phase 2 portion studied 41 men with mCRPC at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 63 mg daily. Based upon the phase 1b/2 data, sabizabulin appears to have both cytotoxic and cytostatic activity. A analysis was conducted evaluating the best clinical response (BCR) defined as either an objective response assessed by PCWG3 criteria and/or stable disease defined as ≥5 cycles (≥15 weeks) of continuous treatment. Results: Of the combined 80 patients in the phase 1b/2 portions of the study, the BCR was 37.5% (30/80) and 5 of the responders remain on study with the longest being treated for more than 30 months. Of the patients with measurable disease at study entry, the BCR was 59% (17/29). Prior to study entry, 11/30 (37%) of those with a BCR had previously been treated with and subsequently progressed on a minimum of 2 ARTAs. The remaining 19/30 (63%) had progressed on a single ARTA agent. 11 (37%) were previously treated with enzalutamide or apalutamide and 8 (27%) with abiraterone as single agents. 8 (27%) received enzalutamide and abiraterone and 3 (10%) patients received more than two ARTAs. As described previously, the safety profile continues to be favorable with no clinically relevant neutropenia or neurotoxicity. Conclusions: In this analysis, sabizabulin has demonstrated not only cytotoxic, but also significant cytostatic activity with similar responses in men that have progressed on a single or multiple ARTA agents. Sabizabulin is a novel agent with the potential provide men with mCRPC a well-tolerated chronic treatment cytostatic option after progressing on an ARTA and is being tested in the open phase 3 VERACITY trial.

       "  '111Background: Prostate cancer often occurs in an elderly population, at higher risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). There is a medical need to increase the knowledge of DDI prevalence and their severity among patients coming from routine care. This study used a prospective approach with the aim to quantify and describe DDIs in medical prescription of prostate cancer treatments. Methods: DDIs were assessed from two perspectives: 1) “real DDI” between the patient’s comedications and the actual anti-cancer agent prescribed; 2) “modelized DDI” between the patient’s comedications and drugs that have proven activity in metastatic endocrine sensitive prostate cancer (MESPC) or castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) settings with positive phase 3 trial and gained EMA approval. French national thesaurus, Micromedex software and complementary manual analysis by pharmacist were used to identified DDIs. Clinical relevance of DDIs was scored using the validated scale of Hatoum. Results: A total of 91 patients were included, 15% of whom were participating in a clinical trial. Some imbalances were observed between patients from clinical trial and routine care (age, ECOG, MESPC/MCRPC). The median number of comedications used per patient was 6 [1-16]. Among real DDI, Enzalutamide was the anticancer agent with the higher risk of interaction (18-54% of patients). In modelized DDI, Enzalutamide and Apalutamide were the two most risky drugs (35-76% and 22-73% depending on Micromedex or Thesaurus analyze). Not all DDIs discovered were clinically significant according to Hatoum scale. Conclusions: DDIs are frequents, according to Micromedex and National Thesaurus tools but pharmacist and physician advices are essentials to determine their potential impacts.',\n",

       "  '112Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly common in clinical practice, but its clinical utility may depend on the availability of sequencing-directed therapies (SDT). There were no FDA-approved SDTs in prostate cancer (PCa) until 2020, when PARP inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib were approved for tumors bearing alterations in certain homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes. We assessed the clinical utility of NGS in PCa before and after the approval of these agents in a single academic medical center. Methods: This was a retrospective single-center study including all PCa patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, NY) between 2018–2021 who received NGS via the 161-gene Sema4 Signal Solid Tumor Panel. Clinical data were extracted from the Mount Sinai electronic medical record using a proprietary automated pipeline with limited manual curation (Sema4 PRODB). The primary outcome was clinical utility in metastatic PCa, defined as the proportion of metastatic PCa patients who received SDT. Secondary outcomes included time-to-next-treatment (TTNT, defined as time from SDT start to the start of next systemic therapy) and the proportion of patients with clinically actionable (as of 9/2021) alterations, defined as either Tier 1 (associated with FDA-approved treatments in prostate cancer) or Tier 2 (associated with either off-label or investigational agents). Results: The cohort consisted of 332 PCa patients; 51% (N = 170) were sequenced in 2020 or later. The median age at diagnosis was 65 (IQR 12). The most advanced stage documented was localized for 39% (N = 129) and metastatic for 61% (N = 203). Overall, 167 actionable alterations were identified in 125 patients (38% of cohort). Of the actionable alterations, 31% (N = 51) were Tier 1 and 69% (N = 116) were Tier 2. Of the 44 patients with Tier 1 alterations, 8 (18%) received SDT (all received olaparib). The proportion of metastatic patients receiving olaparib increased from 1% (2/145) before 2020 to 10% (6/58) during or after 2020 (p = 0.008). Of the 36 patients not receiving olaparib: 20 were sequenced before FDA approval and were treated with an alternative systemic therapy; 8 had localized disease and were not eligible; 8 had limited follow-up or unknown treatment status. For those who received olaparib, median TTNT was 5 months. Conclusions: In this single-center retrospective cohort, clinical utility of NGS was linked to treatment landscape. Increases in NGS test volume and olaparib use coincided with the approval of PARP inhibitors for patients with HRR-mutated prostate cancers. Notably, NGS was used to match patients to off-label/ investigational olaparib before its FDA approval.Disease stateClinical actionabilityNumber of patients (%)All patientsTotal332 (100%)Tier 144 (13%)Tier 2 only97 (29%)MetastaticTotal203 (100%)Tier 136 (18%)Tier 2 only76 (37%)LocalizedTotal129 (100%)Tier 18 (6%)Tier 2 only21 (16%) ',\n",

       "  '113Background: In metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) there is a lack of studies that explore the interaction of comorbidities on treatment outcomes, which presents a challenge in choosing the right drug. In patients with diabetes mellitus, two common therapies, enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone (ABI) have different effectiveness due to different mechanisms of action and because ABI requires co-administration of prednisone. Thus, in this study, we aim to assess the survival of patients with comorbid diabetes treated with ENZ and ABI. Methods: Patients treated with AA or ENZ for mCRPC from September 10, 2014, to June 2, 2017 were identified within the Veterans Health Administration. For these patients, presence of diabetes or complicated diabetes was determined using the Charlson method from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9/10 codes. A Kaplan–Meier time to event analysis and the cox proportional hazards modeling was used to analyze the data with the latter including covariates such as age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body-mass index, treatment with bone-directed therapy, black race, and baseline PSA at start of treatment with ENZ or ABI. Results: We identified 5822 patients treated for mCRPC, of which 2202 had diabetes and were treated using either ENZ (n = 1041) or ABI (n = 1161). Median survival of patients with diabetes treated with ENZ was 3 months longer than in patients treated with ABI (23.8 vs. 20.8, p = 0.002 by log-rank). In 3620 patients without diabetes, no significant difference in median survival (24.7 vs. 22.7 months, p = 0.065) was seen between ENZ (n = 1463) and ABI (n = 2157). In a multivariable model, ENZ was associated with improved survival in patients with diabetes (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.97) and in patients without diabetes (adjusted HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.98). Conclusions: ENZ was associated with improved 3-month median survival in patients with diabetes compared to ABI in unadjusted analyses. Additionally, in adjusted analyses the cox proportional model also showed significantly better survival in mCRPC patients treated with ENZ both with and without diabetes, although the findings are more robust for patients with diabetes. The cause of these differences is unknown, so there may be differences in efficacy and adverse events between the two agents in real-world use. Further assessment of patient outcomes with comorbid disease is appropriate to improve care of patients with advanced prostate cancer.',\n",

       "  '114Background: Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a mainstay of treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Due to inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis, AA can cause mineralocorticoid excess which is suppressed by the co-administration of a glucocorticoid. Prednisolone (P) is widely used to counter the side effects of AA. There is an expanding body of retrospective evidence that dexamethasone (D) may be a more suitable partner for AA and on biochemical progression with AA+P, a ‘steroid switch’ to AA+D may be efficacious in regaining PSA control. Methods: Retrospective analysis patients treated with AA at a UK, tertiary cancer centre, were included to a data cutoff of 28th April 2021. Those who had undergone a steroid switch were identified and baseline data of demographics and clinical history were collected, as well as biochemical and radiological data whilst on AA. Analysis was conducted using SPSS. Biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier U test. Response steroid switch and survival when compared to potential predictive factors was analysed using binomial logistic and Cox regression models. Results: Thirty-three patients were treated with AA and received a steroid switch, AA+P(5mg BD) to AA+D(0.5mg OD) between 2012 and data cutoff. The median age at diagnosis was 71, the majority had Gleason 7 disease (7-10). Nine patients had received prior Docetaxel chemotherapy. Four patients failed to respond to AA+P; three of which achieved a biochemical response after steroid switch. Following switch to AA+D, 24 (73%) of patient achieved a rebound biochemical response after progression on AA+P, of those who achieved a response, 4 (12%) achieved a >30% reduction in PSA, and 12( 36%) achieved a >50% reduction in PSA. The median bPFS before and after steroid switch was 9 (AA+P) vs 19 (AA+P&+D) months (HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.16-0.51; p<.001). Analysis of response to steroid switch showed no significant correlation between response and any investigated clinical factor. A raised ALP(>130U/L) on commencing AA+D predicted for a poorer bPFS (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.1-5.5; p=0.038) and OS (HR 3.2; 95% CI 1.2-8.5; p=0.02). Conclusions: A steroid switch from AA+P to AA+D on biochemical progression is gaining more evidence as a beneficial technique to improve duration of treatment on AA. This study again suggests that bPFS is significantly improved by a steroid switch from P to D. Although negative in this study, several predictive models have been reported to help clinical selection of who may benefit most from a switch. Despite this, there is no official guidance or consensus on when and how a steroid switch should be used and whether this improves overall survival of those with mCRCP. Further randomised, prospective studies are needed to to better define the utility of AA+D, including in the first line setting. ',\n",

       "  '115Background: In ARCHES (NCT02677896), ENZA + ADT improved radiographic progression-free survival, OS, and other key secondary endpoints vs placebo (PBO) + ADT for pts with mHSPC (also known as metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer). Final OS results confirmed a long-term survival benefit with ENZA + ADT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53, 0.81; p<0.0001). We present post hoc analyses of OS by disease volume and progression to M1 HSPC after initial diagnosis with localized disease (M0) or presentation of de novo mHSPC at initial diagnosis (M1). Methods: Pts with mHSPC (N=1150) were randomized 1:1 to ENZA (160 mg/day) + ADT (n=574) or PBO + ADT (n=576), stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use. After unblinding, 180 (31.3%) PBO + ADT-treated pts crossed over to open-label ENZA + ADT. High disease volume was defined per CHAARTED criteria. Medical profiles of pts assessed as MX/unknown metastasis at initial diagnosis (n=213) were further reviewed centrally and adjudicated as having either M0 or M1 disease. Median OS and HRs were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards, respectively. Results: Median treatment duration was 40.2 months (mo) for ENZA + ADT and 13.8 mo for PBO + ADT. Inclusive of crossover, 401 (69.6%) PBO + ADT pts had subsequent life-prolonging therapy. OS benefits with ENZA + ADT were seen in all disease volume and M0/M1 populations at a similar magnitude to the overall population (Table). Median OS was not reached in most populations except PBO + ADT pts with high disease volume (45.9 mo; 95% CI 40.1, not estimable [NE]) or high disease volume and M1 disease (43.4 mo; 95% CI 36.4, 49.7) and ENZA + ADT pts with high disease volume and M0 disease (54.2 mo; 95% CI 54.2, NE). Conclusions: Our post hoc analysis demonstrates consistent long-term survival benefit with ENZA + ADT vs PBO + ADT across pts with mHSPC with high and low disease volumes and M0 or M1 disease at initial diagnosis, despite substantial treatment crossover and subsequent therapy use in PBO + ADT pts.PopulationENZA + ADTa E/n (%)PBO + ADTa E/n (%)HRb (95% CI)Overall154/574 (26.8)202/576 (35.1)0.66 (0.53, 0.81)Low disease volume35/220 (15.9)46/203 (22.7)0.66 (0.43, 1.03)High disease volume119/354 (33.6)156/373 (41.8)0.66 (0.52, 0.83)M1127/448 (28.3)170/442 (38.5)0.63 (0.50, 0.79)M024/117 (20.5)31/129 (24.0)0.71 (0.41, 1.21)Low disease volume + M126/151 (17.2)34/133 (25.6)0.65 (0.39, 1.08)Low disease volume + M08/63 (12.7)12/67 (17.9)0.63 (0.26, 1.54)High disease volume + M1101/297 (34.0)136/309 (44.0)0.63 (0.48, 0.81)High disease volume + M016/54 (29.6)19/62 (30.6)0.77 (0.39, 1.50) aAs randomized; bHR <1 favors ENZA + ADT; HR >1 favors PBO + ADT E, events.

       "  '116Background: In metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the oral treatments of enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone (AA) are used interchangeably because there are few large-scale comparative studies of the therapies. However, both drugs have different mechanisms of action, AA being an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor and ENZ being an androgen receptor inhibitor, so there may be therapeutic variance between the two drugs based on their interactions with comorbid conditions like obesity. Obesity not only increases the risk of other comorbidities, like heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, but has also been implicated in the development of CRPC. Methods: Patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide from September 10, 2014 to June 2, 2017 in the Veterans Health Administration were identified via pharmacy records. Among this population, patients were separated into body mass index (BMI) categories for underweight ( < 18.5), normal (18.5 to < 25), overweight (25 to < 30), and obese ( > 30). Age, Charlson Comorbidity Index and mCRPC treatments were collected and analyzed for the primary outcome of survival via the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was performed with the following variables: BMI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, Black race, treatment with bone-directed therapy, and baseline PSA. Results: In patients with BMI > 25, there was a significantly improved overall survival for treatment with ENZ (n = 1623) over AA (n = 2159), with medians of 30.0 and 27.0 months respectively (p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in survival for patients with BMI < 25 (p = 0.48), with median survival of 17.7 months for ENZ (n = 589) and 16.1 months for AA (n = 860). The overall survival difference between underweight (n = 113), normal (n = 1336), overweight (n = 1879), and obese (n = 1903) groups shows significant increase in survival with increasing BMI, with the median survival durations of 9.2, 15.9, 23.9, and 29.8 months respectively (p < 0.001). This finding was corroborated by the Cox proportional hazard model, with the data indicating an increased risk of death (aHR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.29, 1.94; p < 0.001) with the underweight group and decreased risk with the overweight (aHR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.81; p < 0.001) and obese (aHR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.70; p < 0.001) groups. Conclusions: Treatment with ENZ was associated with longer survival for mCRPC patients with overweight and obesity (BMI > 25) over AA. Otherwise, for normal and underweight patients (BMI < 25), there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two drugs. Higher BMI is associated with improved survival, suggesting a protective effect of obesity in mCRPC patients. While the reason for this finding warrants further investigation, similar findings have been seen in obese patients in some hormone driven cancers, like breast cancer and myeloma.',\n",

       "  '117Background: Intravenous (IV) docetaxel and oral prednisone is a standard of care regimen in mCRPC. ModraDoc006 is a novel, oral tablet formulation of docetaxel. To enhance bioavailability, it is co-administered with ritonavir (/r), an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein metabolic enzymes. The oral combination, denoted as ModraDoc006/r, may be superior to IV docetaxel in terms of safety profile, avoiding infusions, patient quality of life (QoL) and overall resource utilization. Safety of ModraDoc006/r in mCRPC was established in a previous phase Ib trial. Methods: We conducted an open label 1:1 randomized study of ModraDoc006/r bi-daily weekly dosing (BIDW) regimen versus IV docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in 21-day cycles. Initially, BIDW 30-20 mg ModraDoc006 combined with 200-100 mg ritonavir was administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle. After 39 patients the starting dose was reduced to 20-20 mg BIDW with ritonavir 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg with the evening dose to improve tolerability. All patients received 5 mg oral prednisone twice daily. Primary endpoint was radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) per PCWG-3 criteria. Secondary objectives were ORR, PSA-PFS, time to skeletal related events, disease control rate, duration of response, and safety assessments. Patient reported outcomes and health-related QoL was assessed with treatment satisfaction and FACT-P questionnaires at baseline and after cycles 3, 6 and 10. Results: Enrollment is complete with 101 patients accrued; 49 on IV docetaxel, 52 on ModraDoc006/r (21 on 30-20 mg and 31 on ModraDoc006/r 20-20 mg). 69 patients had measurable disease and median PSA was 67ng/ml (range 0,2 to 1697 ng/ml). IV docetaxel vs ModraDoc006/r 30-20 mg and 20-20 mg demonstrated ORR of 39% vs 50% and 33%, and PSA responses of 57% vs 53% and 48%. All grades neutropenia and neuropathy was noted in 0% and 6% with ModraDoc006/r 20-20 mg therapy and was better than the incidence of 14% (5% ≥G3) and 14% with ModraDoc006/r 30-20 mg, and 27% (20% ≥G3) and 31% respectively on IV docetaxel. Alopecia was also reduced at 23% on ModraDoc006/r 20-20 mg and 29% on ModraDoc006/r 30-20 mg vs 43% on IV docetaxel. GI toxicities were slightly more frequent, but predominantly mild, in the ModraDoc006/r arm: at 20-20 mg dose, all grades diarrhea 32% (3% ≥G3), nausea 29% and stomatitis 3% (G3); at 30-20 mg dose 62% diarrhea (19% ≥G3), 38% nausea and 14% stomatitis (5% ≥G3); and in IV docetaxel, 24% diarrhea, 16% nausea and 10% stomatitis (4% ≥G3). Conclusions: Hematological toxicities and adverse events neuropathy and alopecia were lower with ModraDoc006/r than with IV docetaxel. ModraDoc006/r represents a convenient, oral, tolerable option for patients with mCRPC. ModraDoc006/r has comparable efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile as compared to IV docetaxel and merits further development in patients with mCRPC.

       "  '118Background: Abi + p is a standard of care for mCRPC. Cohort D of the phase 1b/2 KEYNOTE-365 study (NCT02861573) was used to evaluate safety and efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor pembro + abi and p in patients (pts) who had not received chemotherapy for mCRPC. Methods: Chemotherapy-naive pts who had not previously used next-generation hormonal agents (NHAs) for mCRPC or were intolerant to enzalutamide or for whom enzalutamide was ineffective for mCRPC, whose disease progressed ≤6 months before screening, and who had ECOG PS score 0/1 were eligible. Enrolled pts received pembro 200 mg IV Q3W + abi 1000 mg PO QD and p 5 mg PO BID. Primary end points were PSA response rate (PSA decrease ≥50% from baseline), confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review, and safety. Secondary end points included rPFS per PCWG3-modified RECIST v1.1, DCR (CR + PR + SD or non-CR/non-PD ≥6 mo), DOR, OS, time to symptomatic skeletal-related event, radiographic bone progression, and radiographic soft tissue progression. Results: Of 103 treated pts, 35.9% had RECIST-measurable disease and 26.2% had previously received enzalutamide. Median (range) time from enrollment to data cutoff was 17.6 (9.7-27.0) months. Confirmed PSA response rate in all 103 pts was 56.3%. Overall, 78.6% of pts had a reduction in PSA level from baseline (confirmed and unconfirmed). For 37 pts with RECIST-measurable disease, ORR was 16.2% (1 CR; 5 PRs) overall, 7.7% for those who previously received enzalutamide (n = 13) and 21.7% for those who had not previously received NHAs (n = 23). Two pts with RECIST-nonmeasurable disease had a CR. DOR was not reached (NR; range, 2.1+ to 19.4+ mo); 4 pts had a response ≥12 months. DCR was 44.7% overall, 11.1% in pts who previously received enzalutamide (n = 27), and 57.3% in pts who had not previously used NHAs (n = 75). Additional analyses are listed in the table. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were experienced by 90.3% of pts; 36.9% experienced grade 3-5 TRAEs. Overall, 18.4% of pts had a grade 3/4 ALT laboratory elevation and 12.6% had a grade 3/4 AST elevation. Five pts died of AEs; 1 was treatment-related (myasthenic syndrome). Conclusions: Pembro + abi and p showed antitumor activity in chemotherapy-naive pts with mCRPC. Safety was generally consistent with individual profiles of each agent, although there was an increased incidence of grade 3/4 ALT/AST laboratory elevations than reported for the individual treatments.

       "  '119Background: Radium-223 is an α-emitting radioisotope that induces DNA double-strand breaks leading to cell death. In preclinical models, PARP inhibitors have shown efficacy as radiosensitizing agents. We designed a phase 1/2 trial to test the safety and efficacy of radium-223 + olaparib. Tissue based studies investigated homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene status. Methods: This was an open-label, multi-center, phase 1/2 study (NCT03317392) evaluating the dosing, safety and efficacy of radium-223 + olaparib. Eligible patients (pts) had mCRPC with ≥2 bone metastases without visceral metastases or lymphadenopathy > 4 cm. There was no limit on prior therapy. All pts had a baseline biopsy and archival tissue was collected when available. The phase 1 used a 3+3 dose escalation design with fixed dose radium-223 (55 kBq/kg IV every 4 weeks x 6). Dose level 1 (DL1) was olaparib 200 mg PO BID; DL2 was olaparib 300 mg PO BID. The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (PCWG3 criteria), PSA response (50% decline from baseline), and alkaline phosphatase response (30% decline from baseline). HRR gene status was determined using Oncopanel tissue profiling. Results: 12 pts were enrolled on the phase 1. Median age was 68 (range 59-81) years. Median prior lines of CRPC therapies was 2 (1-5), including 3 (25%) who had received prior chemotherapy and 12 (100%) a prior novel hormone therapy. The RP2D of olaparib was 200 mg BID when combined with radium-223. Overall, PSA response and alkaline phosphatase response were 16.7% (n=2) and 67% (n=8), respectively. Median follow-up was 6.5 (range 2.8, 11.8) months, and 6-month rPFS was 57% (95% CI: 25%, 80%). 9 patients had available tissue for Oncopanel testing (7 from baseline metastasis biopsy; 2 from archival prostate tissue). Two patients were identified to have pathogenic HRR gene alterations: 1 patient with a BRCA2 mutation with rPFS of 11.63 months, 1 patient with CDK12 mutation with rPFS 2.60 months (Table). Conclusions: We demonstrate that olaparib can be safety combined with radium-223 with RP2D of 200 mg BID. Though limited by sample size, we demonstrate prolonged disease control in a pt with a BRCA2 mutation receiving radium-223 + olaparib. Additional profiling from the currently accruing phase 2 study of radium-223 +/- olaparib will further elucidate biomarkers of response.

       "  '120Background: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a difficult-to-treat cancer with poor patient outcomes. In June 2021, 177Lu-PSMA-617 was granted U.S. FDA breakthrough designation for the treatment of mCRPC based on results from the phase III VISION trial showing a 4-month increased median overall survival (15.3 v 11.3 m; HR 0.62 [0.52-0.74], P < 0.001) and a 5.3-month increased radiographic progression-free survival (8.7 v 3.4 m; HR 0.40 [0.29-0.57] for 177Lu-PSMA-617 versus standard of care (SOC). If approved, 177Lu-PSMA-617 has the potential to improve patient outcomes, but its impact will depend significantly on how community-based medical oncologists (cbMO) plan to integrate it into patient management. The present study surveyed cbMO regarding their perceptions of the VISION trial data and potential barriers to 177Lu-PSMA-617 use in mCRPC. Methods: Between June and October 2021, practicing U.S.-based cbMO were invited to attend a virtual meeting and were presented with the VISION trial data. Their reactions to the data and preferences were collected using audience response technology. Results are presented using descriptive statistics. Results: Among the 287 participating cbMO, median years in practice was 17 (1-45), and median time spent in direct patient care was 90% (20-100%). In the past year, 46% of cbMO managed 6-15 patients with mCRPC, and 27% managed 16 or more. CbMO reported that at the time of referral, their patients with mCRPC had commonly been treated with androgen deprivation therapy (77%) and one (49%) or two plus (20%) novel hormonal agents. After reviewing the recent data from the VISION trial showing improved survival outcomes in mCRPC, 51% of cbMO reported that both the safety and efficacy data were compelling, and they were very likely to prescribe 177Lu-PSMA-617 if approved; 33% indicated that the efficacy data alone was compelling and were likely to prescribe 177Lu-PSMA-617. The top 2 limitations of the VISION trial were identified as PSMA gallium positivity for eligibility (54%) and the disallowance of radium-223 on the SOC arm (48%). Regarding perceived barriers to future use of 177Lu-PSMA-617, 68% and 64% of cbMO reported availability of a PSMA-gallium scan and availability/access of the therapy itself, respectively, would be the greatest barriers. Additional barriers included cost (42%) and difficulty with reimbursement (30%), highlighting the importance of addressing access and financial considerations associated with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Conclusions: Most cbMO found the VISION trial data of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC compelling and indicated that they are likely to incorporate it into their patient management, if approved. However, major barriers such as the incorporation of PSMA-gallium scans, 177Lu-PSMA-617 availability, and cost will need to be addressed to encourage widespread adoption of this new therapy.',\n",

However, OS of patients after progression on first-line NHT for mCSPC is not well characterized. It is currently unknown whether the OS in pts “after” progression on first-line NHT in mCSPC versus mCRPC is significantly different. Herein, our objective was to assess OS after disease progression on NHT given as the first-line therapy in the mCSPC vs first-line therapy in mCRPC setting. Methods: In this IRB-approved study, patient-level data were collected retrospectively, only those treated with NHT as first-line therapy for mCSPC or mCRPC were included. For patients receiving NHT in the mCRPC setting, no prior NHT was allowed in the mCSPC setting. Median overall survival and hazard ratios were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: A total of 173 pts (45 mCSPC and 128 mCRPC) were eligible and included in the analysis. Median OS in the mCSPC versus mCRPC were similar: 23 vs. 17 months, hazard ratio: 0.9855, (95% CI: 0.6225 – 1.560, P=0.951). See the table. Conclusions: These results suggest median OS is similar after progression on one NHT whether given in the first-line mCSPC or first-line mCRPC setting. These data have implications on patient counseling and prognostication as well as the design of clinical trials in patients experiencing disease progression on an NHT. These hypothesis generating data need external validation.mCSPC (N = 45)mCRPC (N = 128)Age at Dx, Median (Range)65 (40 - 81)64 (44 - 94)Gleason, Median (Range)9 (6 - 10)8 (6 - 10)PSA at Baseline, Median (Range)54.1 (0.1 - 5843)32 (1.3 - 663)Visceral Metastases at Baseline, N (%)6 (13%)9 (11%)Median OS after Progression (mos)2317HR (95% CI, P-value)0.9855 (95% CI: 0.6225 – 1.560, P=0.951) ',\n",

       "  '122Background: Enzalutamide and abiraterone plus prednisolone demonstrated improvement of survival for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, it remains quite unclear which agent is better in terms of efficacy and safety for Asian patients. Methods: An investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted in Japan. CRPC patients before chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the enzalutamide or the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm (1:1). The primary endpoint is time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression and secondary endpoints include PSA response rate (≥50% decline from baseline), overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, and safety assessment. Results: Between February 20, 2015 and July 30, 2019, 203 patients were enrolled. After randomization, 92 in the enzalutamide and 92 in the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm were treated and analyzed. Time to PSA progression was not significantly different between arms (median 21.2 and 11.9 months in the enzalutamide and the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm, respectively; hazard ration 0.81, 95% CI 0.51-1.27, p = 0.1732). There was a significant difference in PSA response rate between arms (72% and 57% in the enzalutamide and the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm, respectively, p = 0.0425). There were no significant differences in overall and radiographic progression-free survival between arms (median 32.9 and 35.5months in the enzalutamide and the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm, respectively; hazard ration 1.17, 95% CI 0.72-1.88, p = 0.5290 and median 17.6 and 14.0 months in the enzalutamide and the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm, respectively; hazard ration 0.92, 95% CI 0.63-1.34, p = 0.6532). Grade ≥3 of adverse events were observed in 11% and 21% in the enzalutamide and the abiraterone plus prednisolone arm, respectively (p = 0.1044). Conclusions: Enzalutamide did not show any survival benefits compared with abiraterone plus prednisolone but showed better PSA response rate with no significant differences of severe adverse event rate for Japanese CRPC patients. Our data suggest that antecedent use of enzalutamide to abiraterone plus prednisolone have potentially clinical benefits in Asian CRPC populations. Clinical trial information: UMIN000015529.',\n",

       "  '123Background: In pts with mCSPC undergoing intensified ADT, achieving a PSA nadir ≤0.2 ng/mL “anytime” after the start of treatment was associated with a significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus those with a PSA >0.2 ng/mL: HR 0.17 (95% CI, 0.13-0.23) (Chi AUA 2021, abstract 1281). Our objective was to validate these findings in a real-world population and characterize the clinical and tumor genomic landscape according to PSA response. Methods: In this IRB-approved study, patient-level data were collected retrospectively. Eligibility: presence of mCSPC undergoing intensified ADT with either docetaxel or novel hormonal therapy (NHT) started within 3 months of diagnosis, availability of PSA nadir, and availability of tumor comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) prior to start of ADT. Variants of unknown significance and genomic aberrations present in <5% pts were excluded. Optimal PSA response (OR): PSA≤0.2 ng/mL. Study endpoints: PFS was calculated per PCWG-2 defined PSA progression or radiographic progression or clinical progression whichever occurred first; OS was defined as start of therapy to date of death or censored after last follow-up. The relationship between PSA nadir and both PFS and OS was assessed in the context of Cox proportional hazards. Gene prevalence was compared using a chi square test. Results: 134 pts were eligible and included. Optimal responders (OR) (n=104) and non-OR (n=30): median age at diagnosis 63 vs 65 years; median PSA at ADT start 18.1 vs 74.5 ng/mL; high volume of disease 48% vs 77%. For OR and non-OR: median PFS, 60.6 vs 13.2 (P<0.001); median OS, 94.9 vs 35.2 months (P<0.001) respectively. Multivariate analysis is described in the table. Conclusions: Only a minority of pts with mCSPC do not achieve an optimal PSA response with intensified ADT. Those non-OR have worse outcomes on treatment with intensified ADT. Herein we externally validate that achieving a PSA nadir ≤0.2 ng/mL is correlated with superior OS.

BXCL701 is evaluated in a phase 1b/2 study in combination with pembrolizumab, in mCRPC patients with adenocarcinoma phenotype (and in small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma). Most prostate cancers are classified as adenocarcinomas, characterized by expression of androgen receptor (AR) and PSA. The initial results on the phase 2a adenocarcinoma cohort were reported at ESMO 2021. Here are reported the updated safety and efficacy analyses after enrollment of 40 patients for the adenocarcinoma cohort. Methods: Phase 2a patients with adenocarcinoma required to have progression by PCWG3 on 1 or 2 androgen signaling inhibitor and ≥1 prior line of taxane chemotherapy. Patients received pembrolizumab (200 mg IV q21-days) + BXCL701 0.2 mg BID for a week with step-up to 0.3 mg BID on days 8-14, and 0.3 mg BID on days 1-14 of subsequent cycles. Primary endpoint is Composite Response defined as RECIST 1.1 ± PSA50 ± CTC count conversion. Study uses a Simon 2-stage minimax design with 15 evaluable patients in stage 1 and 13 in stage 2. Baseline markers and changes in relevant immune effector cells also evaluated. Results: As of 9/27/21, 40 adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled (26 evaluable, 12 in active treatment). All had previously received taxane chemotherapy and first and/or second generation Androgen Deprivation Treatments and a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (range 1-11); 44% have bone only disease. Median follow-up duration is 12 weeks (range 1-54)/ 4+ cycles. Although follow-up was short, anti-tumor activity was observed. Composite Response rate was 23% (6/ 26 evaluable patients): 2 RECIST-defined confirmed PR + 1 unconfirmed PR (16%) and 63% disease control rate (defined as PR + SD + non-CR/ non-PD) in 19 patients with measurable disease; 16% PSA50 (3 patients had ̃90% PSA decrease) in 31 patients with ≥1 post-baseline PSA measurement; 25% CTC conversion in 8 CTC evaluable patients. All responders showed decrease in tumor burden, 5/ 6 responders were Micro Satellite Stable. BXCL701 + pembrolizumab demonstrated acceptable tolerability without evidence of increased immune-related AEs compared to historic controls with checkpoint inhibitors. AEs consistent with cytokine activation were observed (hypotension, oedema, fever, fatigue). Conclusions: Oral BXCL701 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrates encouraging anti-tumor activity in very late-line, refractory mCRPC adenocarcinoma.

       "  '127Background: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in regulating the transition from innate to adaptive immunity but has toxicity with systemic administration. M9241 is an immunocytokine composed of 2 IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to one of the H-chains of the NHS76 antibody, which has affinity for both single and double stranded DNA. Thus, M9241 targets delivery to regions of tumor necrosis where DNA has become exposed. NCT01417546, a phase I trial of M9241 at escalating doses, established safety and dosing (Strauss J et\\xa0al, CCR 2019). This was the first use of M9241 in human subjects with solid tumors including PCa. Methods: Nine patients (pts) with PCa enrolled in the phase 1 study, not all of which were presented previously. M9241 was given subcutaneously every 4 weeks (0.1-21.8mcg/kg) or every 2 weeks (12-16.8mcg/kg). PSA declines and immune responses were evaluated including systemic cytokine levels and 30 markers on 158 circulating immune cell subsets. Results: Nine PCa pts were treated with NHS-IL12 and 8 were evaluable for response, including 6 pts with biochemical recurrence and 2 with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (one patient discontinued the study treatment after 1 dose due to grade 3 elevation in ALT). There were no adverse events (AEs) of grade >4. Additional grade 3 toxicities included one each of: leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. The most common AEs of any grade were lymphopenia (77.8%), fatigue (55.6%), and ALT elevation (55.6%). 5 of 8 (62.5%) had PSA declines ranging from 8-42%. After treatment with M9241, evaluable pts had increases in systemic IL-10, TNF and INFg. Additional immune changes included increases in activated subpopulation of natural killer (NK) cells, consistent with the phase 1 experience. Conclusions: M9241 was found to be safe and well tolerated in PCa pts. PSA declines occurred in 5 of 8 evaluable pts. As with the phase 1 study, increases in NK subpopulations were seen in the small number of evaluable pts. These preliminary findings of a necrosis-targeting immunocytokine will be evaluated further in combination studies with cytotoxic therapy. M9241 is currently being evaluated in combination with docetaxel in metastatic prostate cancer (NCT04633252). Clinical trial information: NCT01417546.',\n",

       "  '128Background: mCRPC with alterations in genes associated with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1/2) is sensitive to poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Preclinical studies showed that PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) impairs HR and sensitize cancer cells to PARPi even in the absence of HR gene mutations. These results support our hypothesis that dual PI3K and PARP inhibition may improve clinical outcomes in progressive mCRPC. We describe preliminary results of a phase Ib/II study investigating safety of the combination of copanlisib (pan-class I PI3Ki) and rucaparib (PARP-1, -2 and -3 inhibitor). Methods: Enrollment criteria included progressive mCRPC, prior androgen inhibitors (abiraterone, enzalutamide, and/or apalutamide); prior taxane chemotherapy was allowed. HR-deficiency was not required for the phase Ib. The phase I followed a standard 3+3 escalation design. Dose schema: rucaparib (continuous oral administration twice daily) 400mg (dose level [DL] -1, 1), 500mg (DL 2) or 600mg (DL 3,4) and intravenous copanlisib (45mg D1, D15 (DL -1, -2); 45mg, D1, D8, D15 (DL 1, 2, 3); 60mg, D1, D8, D15 (DL 4); 28-day cycle). Adverse events (AE) were graded by CTCAE v5.0. The primary aim of the phase I was to establish the MTD and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of copanlisib in combination with rucaparib. Results: Eleven pts were enrolled with a median age of 63 (55-78) and median PSA of 12 ng/mL (0.018–2,101). Seven pts (63%) received prior chemotherapy (docetaxel [7], cabazitaxel [3]). Pathogenic HR mutations included BRCA1 (1), BRCA2 (3), CDK12 (1), and FANCA (1). Treatment-related AE included grade 2 (G2) leukopenia (30%), G2 anemia (20%), G2 rash (20%). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in DL 1: G3 rash and G3 AST/ALT elevation attributed to both drugs. Six pts were treated at DL -1 without DLTs. The RP2D was rucaparib 400mg BID with copanlisib 45mg (D1, D15; 28-day cycle). There were 2 confirmed PSA50 responses among 7 evaluable pts (28%). One pt had BRCA2 loss and 1 had PALB2 VUS (ongoing PSA response for 14 mo). Three stable disease and 1 partial response were observed among 6 pts evaluable by RECIST 1.1. Conclusions: The combination of rucaparib and copanlisib is well tolerated. The RP2D was rucaparib 400mg BID with copanlisib 45mg (D1, D15; 28-day cycle) with signal of efficacy.

       "  '129Background: Pathogenic HRR gene mutations may confer sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and/or platinum chemotherapy (chemo). While pts harboring mutations in BRCA1/2 appear to benefit from these DNA damaging therapeutics, outcomes data for those with non-BRCA1/2 mutations are less robust. We evaluated outcomes in men with HRR gene-mutated PC who received treatment with PARPi and/or platinum-based chemo stratified by type of HRR alteration. Methods: Retrospective data from the PROMISE Consortium was utilized (PMID: 34363009). PC pts with pathogenic HRR mutations who received PARPi and/or platinum-based chemo were included. Differences in PSA progression-free survival (PFS), clinical/radiographic PFS (rPFS), and overall survival (OS) between those with BRCA1/2 mutations (Cohort A) and those with mutations in HRR genes that do not directly interact with the BRCA complex (Cohort B: ATM, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL) were evaluated. We also evaluated outcomes in pts with HRR gene mutations known to interact with the BRCA complex aside from BRCA1/2 (Cohort C: RAD51B/C/D, RAD54L2, BARD1, GEN1, PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1). Results: Of 361 pts identified with HRR gene alterations, 89 received PARPi and 70 received platinum-based chemo. Prior therapy and metastatic disease sites were similar between cohorts. PSA PFS, rPFS, and OS were significantly improved in Cohort A vs. Cohort B with PARPi but not platinum-based chemo (Table). Sample size in cohort C was too small to allow for statistical comparison, although PSA PFS, PFS and OS were reasonably long. Conclusions: PC pts with BRCA1/2 mutations had improved outcomes to PARPi compared to those with mutations in HRR genes not directly interacting with the BRCA complex. Platinum-based chemo appeared effective regardless of which HRR gene was affected.

       "  '130Background: Docetaxel is a standard of care for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). PROSTVAC is a pox viral-based therapeutic cancer vaccine encoding for PSA and three T-cell co-stimulatory molecules. Pox viral-based vaccines had previously demonstrated potential immune synergy with docetaxel. This clinical trial evaluated the optimal sequence of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in mCSPC. Methods: Key eligibility criteria were mCSPC within 4 months of ADT and ECOG performance status 0-2. Patients were randomized between Arms A (6 cycles of docetaxel 75mg/m2 followed by 6 doses of PROSTVAC) and B (docetaxel concurrent with PROSTVAC). After rapid accrual to the first 2 arms, Arm C was added by protocol amendment (6 doses of PROSTVAC prior to 6 cycles of docetaxel). ADT was continued throughout the treatment period. The primary endpoint was to evaluate antigen-specific responses to the tumor antigens, PSA and MUC1, and brachyury, a transcription factor implicated in the metastatic process, after patients completed their respective sequence of docetaxel and PROSTVAC. This was done using intracellular cytokine staining of 4 established markers in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, for a total of 8 measures of activation per antigen. Results: The study enrolled 73 patients with a median age of 63 years (range 41-86). Gleason scores for patients were 6 (4.1%), 7 (21.6%) and 8-10 (68.9%), with 5.4% being unknown. Median pre-ADT PSA was 34.75 ng/mL. Per CHAARTED criteria, disease volume was low in 41.1% and high in 58.9% of patients. Numbers of patients evaluable for immune responses in arms A, B, and C were 16, 12 and 18, respectively. Clinical responses have previously been presented (Atiq, MO et\\xa0al., ASCO 2021), with 22% of all patients having PSA <0.2 at 2 years. Conclusions: This data provides some insights into the potential of immune activating therapies in relation to chemotherapy in patients with prostate cancer. This preliminary analysis suggests the greatest magnitude of immune activation is seen when immunotherapy is followed by chemotherapy. Additional analysis of the breadth of immune responses and associations with clinical outcomes is ongoing and will be presented.

       "  '131Background: To analyze the influence of anatomic site in patients with lymph node only recurrent disease in 68Ga-PSMA-PET. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed PFS after salvage lymph node dissection in 98 patients. Patients were stratified to Group 1 advanced (retroperitoneal) (=9), Group 2 atypical (pararectal, presacral)(n=5), Group 3 typical (A iliaca externa, interna, Fossa obturator, A iliaca communis) (n=74) and Group 4 multifocal (combination of all groups)(n=10) recurrence. There were no statistically significant differences in the four patient groups in preoperative clinical parameters. Results: The most obvious PSA reduction after sLAD could have been demonstrated in patients with atypically located lymph node metastases (3.6ng/ml to 0.25ng/ml) although this did not reach statistic significance. Patients in the advanced group showed stable PSA values (3,55ng/ml to 3.26ng/ml). Significant results are seen in Group3 (2,52ng/ml to 1,7ng/ml)(p=0.01). Even patients with multifocal disease had a significant decrease in PSA (3.24ng/ml to 1.41ng/ml). 6- and 12 months PFS for Group 1-4 was 41.7% and 13.9%, 60% and 40%, 52.7% and 25.7% and 60% and 40% respectively. Conclusions: SLAD is an individual treatment approach for patients with lymph node only recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy and or radiotherapy. In our preliminary results we could not demonstrate a significant difference in early oncologic results in the four patient groups. Nevertheless, there might be an influence by patient numbers in the different groups so that a validation in a larger cohort is recommended.',\n",

       "  '132Background: Treatment landscape for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is rapidly evolving. Recent updates of relevant trials and presentation of PEACE-1 results warranted mixed treatment comparisons to inform the choice of treatment in mCSPC. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE, along with conference proceedings were searched using a systematic search strategy to identify relevant abstracts and full-text publications of phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing first-line treatment options in mCSPC. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs). Direct comparisons were made using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis. Fixed-effect frequentist NMA was conducted to compute network estimates using a multivariate meta-regression approach. Relative treatment rankings were assessed in congruency with direct estimates using P-scores. Secondary NMAs were conducted in several substrata (young, and old; Gleason score < 8 and ≥8; performance status 0 and 1-2, low and high volume of disease). Results: This NMA included nine trials (23 references) with nine unique treatments. rPFS was improved with abiraterone acetate and prednisone-docetaxel-androgen deprivation therapy combination (AAP-D-ADT; rank 1) when compared against most treatment options including AAP-ADT (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.76; rank 5), apalutamide (APA)-ADT (HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.87; rank 4), TAK-ADT (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36-0.84; rank 6), and enzalutamide(E)-AAP-ADT (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.97; rank 3), however no significant differences were observed between AAP-D-ADT, and E+ADT (rank 2). Improved OS was observed with AAP-D-ADT (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.95; rank 2), E-AAP-ADT (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.48-0.97; rank 1), and AAP-ADT (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.96; rank 3) compared to D+ADT (rank 6). However, most of the mixed treatment comparisons were statistically insignificant in terms of OS. Similarly, in patients with high volume of disease, AAP+D+ADT (rank 1) was observed to significantly improve rPFS compared to AAP-ADT, APA-ADT, E-ADT, and D-ADT; however, no significant differences were observed among treatment comparisons with regards to OS improvement. E+ADT (rank 1) improved rPFS compared to other treatment in low volume disease but was not different for OS. No significant differences were observed among different treatment options when compared across prespecified subgroups. Moreover, AAP+D+ADT was ranked as the least safe with significantly increased risk of grade 3 AEs relative to other treatments. Conclusions: Current NMA suggests that triplet therapy options were ranked as most likely to improve rPFS and OS at the cost of increased toxicity. Doublet combinations may still be preferred for older patients with low volume of disease.',\n",

       "  '133Background: In the PEACE-1 trial (Fizazi, ESMO 2021), in pts with dn-hv-mCSPC, the addition of abiraterone to ADT + docetaxel (triplet therapy arm) resulted in a median OS of 61 months (OS on ADT + docetaxel arm was 42 months). However, independent contribution of docetaxel to efficacy of ADT + abiraterone in the triplet therapy arm of PEACE-1 trial is not clear. Furthermore, the efficacy of an novel hormonal therapy (NHT) specifically in dn-hv-mCSPC population has not been reported (LATITUDE trial’s eligibility did not include volume status). Herein, our objective was to assess PFS and OS in a cohort of dn-hv-mCSPC pts undergoing intensified ADT with either NHT (i.e. novel androgen receptor or androgen synthesis inhibitors) or docetaxel. Methods: In this IRB-approved study, patient-level data were collected retrospectively. Eligibility: presence of dn-hv-mCSPC (hv per CHAARTED criteria) undergoing intensified ADT with either NHT or docetaxel started within 3 months of diagnosis. Study endpoints: PFS was calculated per PCWG-2 - defined PSA progression or radiographic progression or clinical progression whichever occurred first; OS was defined as start of therapy to date of death or censored at last follow-up. A multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards (Cox-ph) model was used; the relationship between treatment intensification with both PFS and OS was assessed and adjusted for age at diagnosis, Gleason score, presence of visceral metastases, and PSA at baseline. Results: 85 pts with dn-hv-mCSPC were included: 45 received ADT + NHT; 40 received ADT + docetaxel. In the NHT vs docetaxel arms: median PFS were 23 vs 14 months; and median OS were 63 vs 36 months respectively. See the table for Cox-ph and adjusted co-variate results. Conclusions: We for the first-time report the real-world survival outcomes with ADT + NHT specifically in pts with dn-hv-mCSPC. In addition, in these hypothesis-generating data, the OS of pts with dn-hv-mCSPC undergoing ADT + NHT or ADT + docetaxel were similar to those in the triplet therapy arm or ADT + docetaxel arm of PEACE-1 trial respectively. A randomized trial in pts with dn-hv-mCSPC comparing ADT + NHT vs triplet therapy may better characterize the benefit of the docetaxel component in the triplet therapy.VariablePFSHR (95% CI, P-value)OSHR (95% CI, P-value)NHT vs docetaxel0.51 (0.28 - 0.94, P = 0.031)0.55 (0.26 - 1.17, P = 0.12)Age at Diagnosis0.98 (0.95 - 1.01, P = 0.20)0.97 (0.93 - 1.00, P = 0.078)Gleason Score1.28 (0.89 - 1.83, P = 0.18)1.17 (0.76 - 1.8, P = 0.47)PSA at Baseline1.00 (1.00 - 1.00, P = 0.14)1.00 (1.00 - 1.00, P = 0.56)Visceral Metastases at Baseline0.98 (0.47 - 2.03, P = 0.95)1.82 (0.82 - 4.05, P = 0.14) ',\n",

       "  '134Background: Recent trials have suggested poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) sensitivity in patients with treatment-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) harboring mutations in DNA damage and response repair genes (DDR). However, the efficacy profile might differ with different genes and is still being explored in multiple studies. Methods: We systematically searched several electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE), and conference proceedings to include abstracts and full-text publications of phase II/III trials evaluating PARPi in treatment-refractory mCRPC with DDR gene alterations. Outcomes of interest included objective response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), prostate specific antigen (PSA) 50% response, circulating tumor cells conversion (CTCc) from ≥ 5 to < 5 cells, composite response (CoR) and risk of progression. Data was pooled using Inverse-variance approach. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled proportion (PP) of events using the Freeman-Tukey transformation in each gene. Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included five unique trials with 648 patients and four PARPi (niraparib, olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib). Objective response to PARPi was observed in 44.7% of patients with mutations in either BRCA1 or 2 or both (95% CI: 36.0%-53.6%; I2: 0%), 23.5% with ATM (95% CI: 3.91%-51.0%; I2: 65%), 25.0% with CDK12 (95% CI: 8.66%-49.1%), and 45.3% with PALB2 alterations (95% CI: 14.8%-77.5%; I2: 0%). Consistent results were observed for CR outcome. PSA50% response to PARPi was observed in 60.3% of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (95% CI: 50.3%-70.0%; I2: 57%), 5.54% (95% CI: 0.01-16.6; I2: 0%) with ATM, and 70.1% (95% CI: 35.6%-96.6%; I2: 0%) with PALB2 mutations while no PSA 50% response was observed in patients with CDK12 mutations (PP: 0.00%; 95% CI: 0%-16.84%). Moreover, CTCc was observed in 68.3% of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (95% CI: 45.0%-87.8%; I2: 77), 34.2% (95% CI: 11.2-61.3%; I2: 45%) with ATM, 41.7% (95% CI: 15.2%-72.3%) with CDK12, and 48.5% (95% CI: 6.39%-92.9%; I2: 49%) with PALB2. CoR was observed in 76.5% patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (95% CI: 65.4%-86.1%; I2: 22%), 30.4% (95% CI: 16.0%-46.9%) with ATM, 25% (95% CI: 8.66%-49.1%) with CDK12, and 63.9% (95% CI: 31.0%-91.8%; I2: 0%) with PALB2 mutations. Similarly, the risk of progression was 50.9% in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (95% CI: 37.7%-63.9%), 70.9% (95% CI: 60.0%-80.40%; I2: 0%) with ATM, and 75% (95% CI: 19.4-99.3%) with PALB2. Conclusions: Current evidence is sparse regarding efficacy by specific genes. Limited data favors the use of PARPi in mCRPC patients harboring mutations in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 genes.',\n",

       "  '135Background: In pre-operative studies, a short duration of AA + LHRHa produced marked cytoreduction in a subset of men with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, in M0HNPC, androgen signaling inhibition (ASI) is reserved for men with short PSA doubling time. We reasoned that the subset of men who experience cytoreduction with pre-operative AA + LHRHa would also benefit from a short duration of AA + LHRHa at PSA recurrence. This report is a one-year follow-up of our second analysis (ASCO Annual Meeting 2018; PMID 34536949). Methods: FINITE is a phase II trial that randomized (1:1) to two treatment groups, 8 months of LHRHa alone or LHRHa plus AA 1000 mg and prednisone 5 mg daily (NCT01786265). Eligible patients had a rising PSA after definitive therapy and no prior systemic therapy. At disease progression, men were eligible for crossover to 8 months of the alternative therapy. The primary endpoint was PSA-free survival at 12 months (≤ 0.1 ng/dL). Time to PSA progression was calculated from date of initial treatment to date of PSA progression, defined as first occurrence of a rising PSA, if PSA remained detectable after treatment, or when the PSA ≥ 1 ng/dL, if it was undetectable after treatment and confirmed 4 weeks thereafter. The probabilities of PSA progression were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 199 men were randomized, and 197 received initial treatment (LHRHa = 99, LHRHa + AA = 98). Median age at enrollment was 65 years, median PSA was 0.95 ng/dL (range 0.1 – 33.3), and median testosterone was 342.5 ng/dL (10-986). At data cut-off (October 1, 2021), men who received LHRHa + AA were more likely to be PSA-free 12 months after completing treatment (34% vs. 19%, p = 0.02). 168 men (85%) had experienced PSA progression, and median time to PSA progression was 24.3 months for entire cohort. Receipt of LHRHa + AA was associated with longer time to PSA progression than LHRHa alone (27.2 vs. 19.9 months, p = 0.003). Conclusions: Our findings support that finite treatment with AA + LHRHa produces more durable disease-free survival than LHRHa. The finite duration of AA + LHRHa is a toxicity-sparing approach that may allow for a transition from a treatment to curative paradigm for a subset of men with M0HNPC. Further analyses will aim to link the subset of men who benefit from finite AA + LHRHa between localized high-risk PCa and M0HNPC. Clinical trial information: NCT01786265.',\n",

       "  '136Background: Intensification of initial treatment of in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) with androgen pathway inhibition (API) in addition to docetaxel (DOC) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has shown promise to improve clinical outcomes. Thus, we synthesize the data from modern clinical trials to estimate overall estimates of progression and survival outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) was conducted to include phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating triplet therapy (API+DOC+ADT) against doublet therapy (DOC+ADT) in mCSPC. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). A DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analysis was performed to pool precomputed hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) after logarithmic transformation using inverse-variance weighting approach. Cochran’s Q statistical test was used to assess statistically significant heterogeneity not explained by chance, while I2 statistical test was used to quantify the total observed variability, due to between-study heterogeneity. I2 values >50% indicated substantial heterogeneity. A summary of findings table was constructed to translate relative estimates to absolute risks. Results: A total of 1,531 patients in four RCTs with direct comparative data between triplet and doublet therapies, were included in this meta-analysis. PEACE-1 was the only RCT directly assessing this question (AAP+DOC+ADT). ENZA+DOC+ADT was evaluated as a subgroup in two RCTs (ENZAMET; ARCHES), APA+DOC+ADT was evaluated as a subgroup in one (TITAN). To be able to pool studies, the relative efficacy of control arm in ENZAMET (first generation bicalutamide + ADT) was considered equivalent to ADT based on prior literature. A total of 672 rPFS events were observed (34%; 261 events in triplet therapy, 54%; 411 events in doublet therapy). The difference was statistically significant (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.58; I2: 0%). Similarly, 469 OS events were observed (28%; 217 events in triplet therapy, 33%; 252 events in doublet therapy). The difference was statistically significant (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.67-0.96; I2: 0%). The summary of findings is outlined in the table. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis support an improvement in rPFS and OS in favor of triplet therapy over doublet therapy for mCRPC. However, comparative effectiveness of different triplet regimens may be different and needs further exploration.OutcomesAnticipated absolute effectsParticipants (RCTs)Relative effectRisk with DoubletRisk difference with TripletRadiographic progression-free survival1531HR 0.49540 per 1,000224 fewer per 1,000(4 RCTs)(0.42 to 0.58)(262 fewer to 177 fewer)Overall Survival1531HR 0.80331 per 1,00056 fewer per 1,000(4 RCTs)(0.67 to 0.96)(95 fewer to 11 fewer) ',\n",

       "  '137Background: Circulating tumor cells (CTC) detection and androgen receptor splice variant 7 (ARV7) expression have been shown to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients undergoing androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA) treatment, paving the way for alternative treatment options for patients with negative predictive factors. Full-length androgen receptor (ARFL), prostate specific membrane antigen and prostate specific antigen (PSA) may further help to refine prognostic models. In our institution, a prospective observational trial testing CTC detection in mCRPC undergoing ARTA treatment (PRIMERA trial, NCT04188275) terminated the planned enrollment in 2020. Here we present early results of the overall cohort. Methods: PRIMERA (NCT04188275) is a prospective, observational trial enrolling mCRPC patients undergoing ARTA treatment. All patients were treated with either abiraterone or enzalutamide in I line setting. Blood samples to detect CTCs were taken before starting ARTA treatment. Reverse transcription - quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the CTC expression of PSA, PSMA, AR and ARV7. PSA drop (defined as difference between baseline PSA at ARTA treatment start and PSA at nadir under treatment), progression free and overall survival (PFS and OS) and their correlation with CTC detection were reported. Explorative analysis about AR, PSA and PSMA expression in CTC+ patients were conducted. Results: Overall, 44 patients were included. CTC were detected at treatment start in 19 patients (43,2%), of whom 3(15,78%), 9(63,15%), 15(78,94%) and 14 (73.68%) patients expressed ARV7, ARFL, PSA and PSMA, respectively. Biochemical response was significantly improved in CTC+ vs. CTC- patients, with median PSA drop values of 18.5 vs 2.5 ng/ml (p=0.03). After a median follow up of 18 months, 22 (50%) patients progressed. PFS was significantly longer in CTC- patients (not reached vs 16 months, respectively, p=0.02). Eight (18.2%) patients died, a non-significant trend in terms of overall survival was detected in favor of CTC- patients (not reached vs 29 months, respectively, p=0.05). AR, PSA and PSMA expression in CTC+ had no significant impact on PSA drop, PFS or OS. Conclusions: PRIMERA trial confirmed the CTC detection predictive importance in mCRPC patients. Adequately powered studies will be needed to further explore CTC profiling in this setting. Clinical trial information: NCT04188275.',\n",

       "  '138Background: AR alterations such as ligand binding domain mutations and amplification evolve under the selective pressure of testosterone suppression and AR targeted agents (ARTA) such as abiraterone or enzalutamide, but their relevance to ARTA treatment outcomes remain unclear. Methods: PROMISE is a multi-institutional retrospective clinical-genomic database inclusive of aPC pts who had tissue and/or blood based genomic testing by commercially available CLIA-certified platforms. We analyzed men who received second generation ARTA and stratified patients according to genomic testing timing (pre-/post-ARTA), castration resistance, type of AR alteration, and PSA decline ≥50% on first ARTA. Time to progression (TTP) from first ARTA initiation was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between subgroups defined by AR alteration status were assessed using the log-rank test. Results: 854 pts who received ARTA and had tissue-based (n = 600) or blood-based (n = 335) genomic testing were included. Median age was 62 (range, 33-93). Pre- and post-ARTA genomic testing was available in 387 and 467 pts, respectively. AR alterations were identified in 16% (61/387) of pre-ARTA and 48% (226/467) of post-ARTA pts with AR amplifications in 10% (38/387) and 35% (161/467) of the pts, respectively. 15/52 pts who had pre- and post-ARTA testing developed a new AR alteration. In pre-ARTA cohort; castration status, median TTP, and PSA response for 1st ARTA according to alteration status are summarized in the table. In the post-ARTA group, the most common AR mutations were L702H (53%), followed by T878A (33%); whereas, in the pre-ARTA group, the H875Y (26%) mutation was most common. AR mutations in post-ARTA group were seen at similar rates regardless of prior docetaxel exposure (14.3% vs 18.0%, p = 0.46) and following first abiraterone vs enzalutamide/apalutamide exposure (48.6% vs 48.3%, p = 1.0). Conclusions: AR mutations, unlike amplifications, were associated with shorter TTP on abiraterone.

       "  '139Background: Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi) are a mainstay for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, patient response is heterogeneous and the molecular underpinnings of ARSi resistance are not well elucidated. Methods: We performed transcriptome analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the context of PROPHECY, a prospective clinical trial of men (n = 118) with mCRPC treated with abiraterone (Abi) or enzalutamide (Enza). We obtained CTCs at baseline (before treatment) and at the time of progression on Abi/Enza, performed a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of CTC patient samples (n = 40) and correlated with clinical outcomes to identify mechanisms of ARSi resistance. In addition, we also performed a transcriptomic analysis of matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to uncover potential involvement of the circulating immune macroenvironment (CIME) in ARSi resistance. The proportional hazard model was used to determine the prognostic significance of these signatures in predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: CTC RNA-sequencing identified that RB loss concurrently with enhanced E2F signaling transcriptional networks were associated with intrinsic ARSi resistance. Using single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) score, we identified that the RB/E2F common signature at baseline was associated with short PFS (median PFS = 6.5 months) and OS (median OS = 24.5 months) (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.5; 95% CI 1.5-8.2) in men with mCRPC. We further developed a BRCA loss transcriptional signature which we validated in the SU2C mCRPC patient cohort, by showing that BRCA loss transcriptional network reflected BRCA genomic alterations as it was significantly enriched in the SU2C BRCA-altered patients vs unaltered patients. Generating BRCA loss ssGSEA scores in the PROPHECY cohort we observed that patients with high BRCA loss scores at baseline experienced shorter OS (HR = 2.42; 95% CI = 1-5.9). Through the comparison of CTC transcriptomic profiles at progression with baseline, we identified an inflammatory response signature in CTCs which was significantly associated with acquired ARSi resistance. Transcriptomic analysis of matching PBMCs identified enrichment of inflammasome gene signatures indicative of activated innate immunity at progression, with concurrent downregulation of CD8 T and NK cells. Importantly, CTC gene signatures of RB loss/E2F signaling had a significant positive association with this CIME signatures. Conclusions: Taken together, these data demonstrate that liquid biopsy transcriptomics of both tumor cells and immune cells can identify molecular pathways associated with clinical ARSi resistance paving the way for treatment optimization and the development of novel precision therapies in patients with mCRPC.',\n",

       "  '140Background: AAP prolongs survival in pts with mCRPC. Although it is widely used for mCRPC, no predictive biomarker for response has been identified so far. Methods: This study evaluated HSD3B1 genetic polymorphism and pharmacodynamic parameters from serum samples of mCRPC pts with disease progression after diethylstilbestrol (DES) treated with AAP in the AAP-DES study (NCT02217566). Peripheral blood samples were collected before initiating AAP therapy, after 12 weeks, and at disease progression. Sample analysis included HSD3B1 genotyping, abiraterone acetate (AbA) and D4-abiraterone serum levels, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) ultrasensitive analysis. Clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and the rate of PSA decline ≥ 50% were assessed considering homozygous wild-type (AA) versus heterozygous variant (AC) + homozygous variant (CC) HSD3B1 genotypes. Results: Serum samples of 42 pts were analyzed. AA and AC + CC HSD3B1 genotypes were 50.0% each (95% CI:34.2-65.8). Mean ages at baseline was significantly higher in the AA group (71.1 years) compared to the AC+CC group (66.3 years) (p=0.047). Gleason score ≥8 was observed for 38.1% and 47.6% of AA and AC+CC genotypes, respectively (p<0.001). No statistically significant difference was observed between AA and AC+CC groups related to testosterone and DHEA-S level at baseline, week 12, and PSA progression. Serum levels of AbA and D4-abiraterone were similar, throughout treatment despite HSD3D1 genotype. Median OS was 21.3 months (95% CI: 14.8 - ; 14 events) for the AA genotype, and it was not reached at the AC+CC genotype group (9 events) (p=0.154). Regarding PFS, median estimates were 7.3 months (95% CI: 4.6 – 9.4; 16 events) for AA genotype and 7.9 months (95% CI: 5.6 – 14.4; 16 events) for AC+CC genotype (p=0.519). PSA decline ≥ 50% was 71.4% for AA genotype and 42.9% for AC+CC genotypes and the chance of PSA response in patients with AA genotype is 3.33 (95% CI: 0.93; 12.11) times greater than that in patients with AC or CC genotypes, despite not statistically significant differences (p=0.0614). Conclusions: In our study, the presence of HSD3B1 (1245C) was not significantly associated with clinical response during AAP treatment, as well as testosterone, DHEA-S, AbA and D4-abiraterone levels. The role of HSD3B1 polymorphism to predict clinical outcome of AR blockade for mCRPC patients still needs to be further analyzed in larger translational studies.

       "  '141Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in poorly differentiated, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancers. Recently, 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography has been successfully developed as an effective diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. However, the pathophysiological functions of PSMA in prostate tumors remain unclear. Methods: We examined the protein expression of PSMA in tumor endothelial cells in human prostate tumors by immunohistochemistry. Prostate cancer tissues were resected from patients with prostate cancer via robotic surgery in 2019 at Ehime University. In vitro, we prepared conditioned medium derived from a PSMA-positive human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, cultured on collagen I gels. We then examined PSMA expression in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with the conditioned medium. We assessed angiogenic activities by treating HUVECs with LNCaP-derived conditioned medium using a tube formation assay that mimics angiogenesis. Results: Immunohistochemical positivity of PSMA and CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, and PSMA-expressing tumor endothelial cells were observed in four of 33 prostate cancer patients (12.1%). We also found that the 10,000 ´ g pellet fraction of the LNCaP-derived conditioned medium containing PSMA-positive membranes, including microvesicles, transformed HUVECs from “PSMA-negative” to “PSMA-positive.” Mass spectrometry revealed that the fraction contained an important growth factor. Furthermore, treating HUVECs with the 10,000 ´ g pellet fraction of the LNCaP-derived conditioned medium significantly promoted tube formation, mimicking angiogenesis in a PSMA-dependent manner. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the existence of PSMA-positive tumor endothelial cells in human prostate tumors, which were found to enhance tumor angiogenesis in prostate cancer tissues. The endocytic process related to these PSMA-positive microvesicles in normal endothelial cells might be an attractive target to develop novel anti-angiogenic drugs, which could inhibit the transformation of normal endothelial cells into tumor endothelial cells (Watanabe et\\xa0al., The Prostate. 2021. in press).',\n",

       "  \"142Background: In ACIS, APA + AAP improved radiographic progression-free survival in mCRPC vs AAP; difference in overall survival (OS) was not statistically significant. We report a prespecified analysis of androgen receptor (AR) or non-AR genomic/transcriptional aberrations, known to be associated with poor prognosis, and their associations with OS in patients (pts) with mCRPC. Methods: Circulating tumor (ct)DNA and aberrations in 17 PC-relevant genes were assessed using next-generation sequencing at baseline (BL; n = 197) and at end of study treatment (EOST; n = 140) (biomarker population). ctDNA was summarized qualitatively; genomic aberrations were normalized by ctDNA detection. AR splice variant version 7 (ARv7) was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Cox proportional hazards model assessed association of OS with biomarkers in univariate/multivariate analyses overall and in pts receiving subsequent treatment (tx). Results: BL characteristics of biomarker and total study populations were similar. From BL to EOST: ctDNA detection did not differ (123/196 [63%] to 92/140 [66%], p=0.6); significant increases occurred in ARv7, AR mutations, and any AR aberration (Table). Prevalence of aberrations in PI3K and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways did not change from BL to EOST (40/123 [33%] to 34/92 [37%], p=0.5 and 18/123 [15%] to 14/92 [15%], p>0.9, respectively). Worse OS was associated with ctDNA detection or HRR pathway inactivation at BL (HR, 2.5 or 2.2; all p < 0.001) or presence of ctDNA, ARv7, AR amplification or inactivation of TP53, RB1, or RB1/TP35 pathway at EOST (2.2, p < 0.001; 2.1, p < 0.001; 2.6, p < 0.001; 1.5, p < 0.05; 1.7, p < 0.05; 2.1, p < 0.001, respectively) in univariate analyses. EOST ARv7, AR amplification, and inactivation of RB1, TP53, or RB1/TP53 pathway was associated with worse OS in pts receiving subsequent tx. Detection of ctDNA and RB1 inactivation at BL and RB1/TP53 pathway inactivation at EOST was strongly associated with worse OS (2.1, 3.3, 2.9, respectively, all p < 0.01) in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: In ACIS, AAP or APA + AAP tx was associated with increased AR mutations and ARv7 expression. Detection of ctDNA and select AR/non-AR aberrations may predict poor survival in mCRPC. These markers may be used to improve tx selection following confirmation of their predictive value.

       "  '143Background: Genomic tumor testing is now recommended for all patients with mPC, but the relevance of archival vs contemporaneous tumor tissue profiling remains unclear. We studied genomic biomarkers, including homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations, and genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) as signature of genome-wide instability, in a cohort of mPC patients with tissue specimens collected at varying points along disease progression. Methods: Genomics and clinical data from 1302 men with mPC from the US-wide de-identified Flatiron Health Foundation Medicine clinico-genomic database. The de-identified data originated from ̃280 US cancer clinics (̃800 sites of care). Comprehensive genomic profiling of primary or metastatic tissue specimens acquired at diagnosis (“ADT naïve” n = 840), at castration resistance (“ADT exposed” n = 132) or after resistance to novel hormonal therapies (“NHT exposed” n = 330). Aim 1: compare genomic biomarkers across disease progression states in primary vs metastatic tissue specimens. Aim 2: study gLOH across clinical states. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis (MVA) used linear regression. Adjustment for multiple testing considered a false discovery rate at 0.05. Results: Most ADT-naïve samples were primary tumor specimens (80%); most post-NHT biopsies came from nodal (27%), liver (25%) or bone (16%) metastasis. There was an enrichment in more advanced disease states (ADT-naïve vs ADT-exposed vs NHT-CRPC) for aberrations in AR, MYC, TP53, PTEN and RB1 (all adjusted p-values < 0.05); prevalence of BRCA1/2 and other HRR aberrations was stable along disease progression states. Within the ADT-naïve group, there was no difference in prevalence in primary vs metastatic lesions of TP53 (36.4% vs 31.3%), PTEN (26.3% vs 33.1%), BRCA2 (8.2% vs 6.6%), RB1 (3.3% vs 6%) or MYC (5% vs 7.2%) (all adjusted p-values > 0.3). Overall, 847 cases were evaluable for gLOH scores. In MVA, prior exposure to NHT was associated with higher gLOH independent of genomic features, taxane exposure or biopsy site (primary/M1). Among the genomic features, aberrations in BRCA2, FANCA, PALB2, TP53 and RB1 were independently associated with increased gLOH. Conclusions: Progression to hormonal therapies associates with enrichment for aberrations in AR, MYC, PTEN and cell-cycle genes (TP53, RB1) for which contemporaneous assessment would be most accurate. In turn, prevalence of mutations in BRCA1/2 and other HRR genes is stable along mPC progression, supporting potential use of primary tumor biopsies to determine mPC patient eligibility for PARPi treatment. Progression to hormonal therapies associated with higher gLOH, independently of genomic features, suggesting advanced prostate cancer is enriched for genomic instability features.',\n",

       "  '144Background: The germline I1307K mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is a well known alteration identified in approximately 6% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Individuals with this mutation have an increased risk of developing colorectal and other cancers. The implications of the APC (I1307K) mutation in patients with prostate cancer are unknown. We sought to determine the clinical outcomes of patients with prostate cancer and the germline APC (I1307K) mutation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records from New York University and Johns Hopkins University to identify patients with the APC (I1307K) mutation. Eligibility criteria included the identification of the mutation either on germline or somatic tissue testing (when germline testing was not available). Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) was defined using previously established criteria including: presence of small cell histology, presence of exclusively visceral metastases, bulky prostate mass or lymphadenopathy, low PSA with high-volume ( > 20) bone metastases, neuroendocrine marker positivity or short interval ( < 6 months) to castration resistance. Combined somatic alterations in two or more of following genes were assessed: RB1, TP53, PTEN. These somatic alterations have been previously associated with AVPC. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient data. Results: From 2016-2021, 13 patients with the germline APC (I1307K) mutation were identified. At the time of analysis 9 (69%) patients were alive. Most patients (7; 54%) had metastatic disease at presentation. Median PSA at diagnosis was 0.4 ng/mL (range: 0.4-20 ng/mL). The median time to castration resistance among those receiving hormonal therapy was 9 months (range: 3-13 months). Presence of small cell histology was found on initial biopsy in 3 patients and on subsequent biopsy in 1 additional patient (31% overall). Bulky prostate mass or lymphadenopathy was found in 3 (23%) patients. There were 2 (15%) patients who had low PSA with high-volume bone metastases. Four (31%) patients had radiographic progression with no concordant PSA increase. Clinically-defined AVPC was found in 7 (54%) patients and in 100% of those patients with metastatic disease. Combined somatic alterations in two or more of RB1, TP53 or PTEN were identified in 3 (23%) patients. Conclusions: Prostate cancers that develop in the presence of the germline APC (I1307K) mutation appear to be enriched for clinically-defined and molecularly-defined AVPC. Several of these patients demonstrated small cell histology and PSA-independent progression, higher than the expected background rate. This raises the hypothesis that the germline APC (I1307K) mutation influences the somatic genomic and/or epigenomic landscape of prostate cancer. Larger studies to validate the increased risk of AVPC in APC (I1307K) carriers, and to elucidate the somatic alteration landscape in these patients, are ongoing.',\n",

       "  '145Background: In the phase 3 CHAARTED trial pts with mHSPC treated with ADT + D had an improved overall survival (OS) and longer time to castrate resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC) than pts treated with ADT alone. We aimed to define the association of BTM levels with pt outcomes recognizing both ADT and bone metastases impact bone turnover. Methods: Serum samples were collected at baseline (BL) (within 28 days of starting ADT) in 233 (116 in ADT, 117 in ADT+D) pts and at week 24 in 423 (224 ADT+D, 199 ADT) pts. Samples were analyzed for osteocalcin (OC), osteoprotegrin (OPG), sclerostin (SL), RANKL and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP). Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the prognostic and predictive effects of the BTM in terms of OS and TTCPRC. Results: Whereas BALP baseline (BL) level < BL median was associated with longer OS independent of therapy (HR 0.44 95% CI 0.31-0.63, p<0.001); BL OPG > BL median and BL RANKL < BL median were associated with longer OS in the ADT+D arm (HR 0.54 95% CI 0.32-0.9, p=0.015 and HR 1.69 95% CI 1,03-2.79, p=0.037) but not in the ADT alone arm (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.45 − 1.25, p=0.271 and HR 1.06 95% CI 0.65 − 1.73 p=0.827). Changes in markers from BL to week 24 varied based on treatment and volume of disease with statistically significant changes noted (Table). A rise in OC or BALP on therapy from BL to week 24 was associated with improved TTCRPC and OS (OC: HR(TTCRPC) 0.792, p=0.033, HR(OS) 0.78 p=0.047; BALP: HR(TTCRPC) 0.82, p=0.03, HR (OS) 0.79, p=0.013) controlling for week 24 levels. However higher absolute OC and BALP levels at week 24 were associated with worse outcomes. (OC: HR(TTCRPC) 1.37, p=0.003, HR(OS)1.38, p=0.006; BALP: HR(TTCRPC) 1.54, p=0.007, HR(OS) 1.77, p=0.001). Conclusions: The BL finding with BALP are consistent with higher BALP being a poor prognostic marker. The BL OPG and RANKL findings suggest these markers might identify men who benefit from addingf D to ADT. The paradoxical improved survival with a rise in OC and BALP on therapy but worse outcomes with absolute higher levels at week 24 highlights complex dynamics of bone turnover related to varied impact from ADT, bone healing when responding to therapy versus active cancer.

       "  '146Background: The CHAARTED study showed that adding docetaxel (Doc) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men initiating treatment for mHSPC prolongs survival, particularly in high-volume disease. Androgens are known drivers of both mHSPC and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Lower nadir testosterone (T) is associated with better outcomes in men treated with ADT for biochemical relapse, while higher androgens at mCRPC are associated with better prognosis and increased benefit from abiraterone. Methods: We evaluated the association of serum steroid levels at 24 weeks with overall survival (OS) and time to CRPC (TTCRPC) in 588 men with available samples from the CHAARTED study. Steroid levels were measured using mass spectrometry. Results: The median (med) T level at 24 weeks was 8 ng/dl and did not differ in the ADT alone vs ADT plus Doc arms. Achieving a nadir T below 20ng/dl was not associated with OS or TTCRPC in either arm. In the ADT arm pregnenolone (preg) and T levels > med associated with longer OS (HR 0.62; p = 0.017 for both), as did AED and T levels in the highest 3 quartiles (HR 0.61 p = 0.025; HR 0.67, p = 0.069). OS did not differ by steroid levels in high volume patients. In low volume patients OS was longer for those in the highest 3 quartiles of progesterone (HR 0.52 p = 0.10), DHEA (HR 0.41 p = 0.03), AED (HR 0.39 p = 0.027), T (HR 0.36 p = 0.006) and estrone (HR 0.52 p = 0.10). In the ADT + Doc arm estrone levels < med associated with longer OS (HR 0.68; p = 0.05) as did AED levels in the lowest quartile (HR 0.67 p = 0.063). Estrone levels < med also associated with longer TTCRPC (HR 0.75; p = 0.097), as did AED and estrone in the lowest quartiles (HR 0.60 p = 0.009; HR 0.65 p = 0.05). There was no difference in OS in either the high or low volume patients based on steroid levels. In high volume patients, OS was particularly longer with ADT + Doc vs ADT in those with estradiol or estrone levels in the highest 3 quartiles (p = 0.018; 0.029) and in those with pregnenolone, AED, T, and DHT in the lowest quartile (p = 0.046, p = 0.018, p = 0.095; p = 0.066). In low volume patients, OS was also longer with ADT + Doc vs ADT in those with T levels in the lowest quartile (p = 0.055), but shorter with ADT + Doc vs ADT among those with progesterone, DHEA, AED, T and estrone levels in the top 3 quartiles (p = 0.095; p = 0.071; p = 0.091; p = 0.031; and p = 0.031). Conclusions: In men with mHNPC treated with ADT alone higher steroid levels at 24 weeks associate with longer OS (primarily in low volume disease), consistent with findings in the mCRPC setting (Mostaghel et\\xa0al CCR 2021). In men treated with ADT + Doc lower levels of estrone and AED associate with longer OS and TTCRPC. The findings overall highlight that serum steroid levels associate with different patient outcomes depending on whether treated with ADT alone or with Doc, as well as the prognostic variable of high vs low volume disease.

       "  '147Background: Spinal cord compression (SCC) from prostatic cancer is an oncologic emergency with significant negative impact on morbidity and survival. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in spinal metastases remains largely unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathology, molecular profiles, and outcome in these patients. Methods: Twenty patients with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed metastatic SCC from prostate cancer were identified at Dignity health Cancer Institute. Pathology slides were reviewed and the molecular analysis of 324 cancer-related genes was performed on tumor specimens using targeted next-generation sequencing. Characteristics including age, Gleason score, SCC anatomical site, time to diagnosis of SCC, gene alterations, number of lines of treatment and clinical outcome were analyzed. Results: At the time of diagnosis of SCC, the median age at diagnosis of SCC was 60.5 years old (range=50-76). The median PSA value was 626 ng/ml, 100% of patients have a Gleason score above 7, 30% of patients had visceral metastases. The thoracic spine affecting (15/20) patients is the most common site of SCC. Seventeen patients (75%) were initially treated with surgery combined with radiation therapy (RT), whereas 3 (15%) were managed with RT alone. At the time of this study, 11 patients remain alive (55%), median overall survival (OS) is 20 months, 18 months in treatment naive and 22 months in hormone refractory patients. Molecular analysis revealed gene mutations in all (100%) tumors, The most common gene alterations were PTEN (16%), followed by AR alterations AR (13%), TP53 (11%), TMPRSS2-ERG (8 %), BRCA1/2(4%), RB1(1%) and ATM (1%).

       "  '148Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heritable malignancy. Germline mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, especially in in ATM, BRCA2 and CHEK2, are common in men with PCa, but how these influence somatic mutations is unknown. Characterizing the somatic landscape of tumors from germline HRR-altered PCa patients may provide insights into further therapeutic strategies and identify individuals most likely to benefit from existing therapies. Methods: We retrospectively identified 118 men with germline HRR-altered PCa from Johns Hopkins with available somatic mutation data (gATM, n = 30; gBRCA2, n = 58; gCHEK2, n = 30). In these patients, somatic NGS analysis were done primarily using prostatic (rather than metastatic) tissues. The proportion of patients in each group with somatic biallelic inactivation was determined. We then compared the somatic mutation landscapes of the 3 groups, focusing on key PCa-relevant genes including AR, TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, TP53, BRCA2, ATM, CDK12, APC, FOXA1, AKT1, PIK3CA, and KDM6A among others. Somatic mutation data from primary prostate cancer specimens (n = 3965) found in pooled studies (n = 23) from cBioPortal were included as a reference standard for comparison. Results: Biallelic somatic inactivation was detected in 59% (34/58) of gBRCA2-altered, 47% (14/30) of gATM-altered, and 0% (0/30) of gCHEK2-altered patients. In all 118 germline HRR-altered individuals, the most common somatic mutations were in BRCA2 (31%), FOXA1 (26%), TMPRSS2-ERG (20%), TP53 (16%), PTEN (15%), and ATM (15%). gBRCA2-altered patients had a higher prevalence of somatic mutations in AR (9% vs 3% in cBioPortal, P < 0.05) and FOXA1 (29% vs 13% in cBioPortal, P > 0.05), suggesting a greater dependency on AR signaling, but a lower prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusions (17% vs 33% in cBioPortal, P < 0.05). gATM-altered patients had a strikingly low prevalence of somatic TP53 mutations (3% vs 25% in cBioPortal, P < 0.01), indicating mutual exclusivity between these genes. gCHEK2-altered patients had a higher prevalence of somatic CDK12 mutations (10% vs 0% in gATM/gBRCA2 patients, P < 0.05), implying an interaction between CHEK2 and CDK12. No differences were seen between the three groups with respect to alterations in the PI3K/PTEN pathway, WNT pathway, or chromatin-related genes. Conclusions: Biallelic inactivation was frequently observed in PCa patients harboring gATM and gBRCA2 mutations, but not in those with gCHEK2 mutations. gBRCA2-altered patients were enriched for somatic AR (and FOXA1) mutations and were depleted for TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. gATM-altered patients were depleted for somatic TP53 mutations, while gCHEK2-altered patients were enriched for somatic CDK12 mutations. Thus, germline mutations appear to impose selective pressures that influence somatic mutation landscapes in PCa.',\n",

       "  '149Background: Therapy-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an extremely aggressive variant of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is increasing in incidence with the widespread use of second generation of androgen receptor (AR)-pathway inhibitors (APIs) such as enzalutamide (ENZ) and abiraterone. This aggressive variant arises from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) via a reversible trans-differentiation process, referred to as neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) wherein cells undergo a lineage switch and exhibit neuroendocrine (NE) features, characterized by expression of neuronal markers such as enolase 2 (ENO2), chromogranin A (CHGA) and synaptophysin (SYP). Currently, histopathological assessment combined with immunohistochemical detection in PCa tissues/serum levels of neuronal markers including SYP, NSE, CHGA and CD56 is currently used to monitor NED in CRPC patients. However, these markers are not sufficiently specific, highlighting the urgent need of novel molecular markers to assess emergence of NED in CRPC patients. Recently, we demonstrated that progression of advanced CRPC with adenocarcinoma characteristics to CRPC-NE is associated with a characteristic set of miRNA alterations that promote plasticity of advanced PCa to NEPC (Bhagirath et\\xa0al., Oncogene, 2020). Importantly, we could develop a ‘novel miRNA classifier’ to robustly stratify CRPC-NE tumors from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas. Here we further validate the classifier in independent clinical cohorts and deduce the optimal miRNA genes required for NEPC diagnosis. Methods: Human clinical samples with corresponding clinical information were procured from two independent sites of Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network (PCBN). FFPE sections from clinical samples were microdissected, RNA were extracted and small RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequencing data were analyzed and machine learning algorithms were applied. The performance of classifier was measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Results: Unsupervised analysis of sequencing data by principal component analyses (PCA) revealed distinct clustering of the CRPC-NE tumors from CRPC-Adenocarcinomas based on miRNA profiles suggesting that miRNA profiles can be used to stratify these tumor types. We applied the ‘43-miRNA classifier data’ we deduced earlier to these validation cohorts. Our analyses showed that a set of 5 miRNAs of the classifier are important in distinguishing between CRPC-Adeno vs CRPC-NE with an AUC=0.8318. Conclusions: A ‘5- miRNA’ classifier was validated to be of significance in two independent validation cohorts. We propose this miRNA classifier as an important tool for diagnosing NED in CRPC patients.',\n",

       "  '150Background: With the evolving use of targeted therapies exploiting genomic vulnerabilities in mCRPC, screening patients for sensitizing alterations is of increasing relevance. However, the influence of age on the detection of relevant genomic alterations is incompletely understood. In this study, we compared the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) profiles of younger (age <70) versus older (age ≥70) men with mCRPC and assessed the relative prognostic impact of common genomic alterations. Methods: A next-generation sequencing-based Predicine cfDNA assay was used to profile 276 mCRPC patients from two independent international cohorts. The frequency of genomic alterations across age categories was compared using the chi-squared test, while circulating tumour DNA fraction (ctDNA%) was compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Cox proportional hazards analysis with interaction testing was used to assess the association between age, genomic alteration and overall survival. Results: The median age of the combined cohort was 72 years (IQR 66-78), with 170 (62%) patients ≥70 years old. Despite differences in baseline characteristics (poorer performance status in older patients, higher Gleason score and de novo metastatic disease in younger patients), there was no significant difference in ctDNA% (median 22% vs 30%, p=0.6). We observed similar frequencies of genomic alterations across the 10 most commonly aberrant genes, including AR (<70 vs ≥70: 46% vs 49%, p=0.6), TP53 (40% vs 36%, p=0.6), BRCA2 (29% vs 21%, p=0.13) and PTEN (39% vs 35%, p=0.5). This similarity persisted when analysing mutations and copy number alterations in isolation. While driver alterations in both age categories were strongly associated with unfavourable outcomes (Table), an exploratory analysis revealed that copy number gain in PIK3CA may have a worse prognostic impact in younger men (p for interaction = 0.03), with a lesser effect observed in AR gain (p = 0.1) and MYC gain (p = 0.1). Conclusions: The genomic profiles of pertinent alterations between younger and older men are comparable. Certain genomic alterations may carry a worse prognosis in younger men. Patients should be considered for precision medicine assessment and directed therapies, regardless of age.

       "  '151Background: The use of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) may trigger synthetic lethality of tumor cells in the context of deficient homologous recombination repair (HRR). Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer harbor mutations in the HRR pathway, but HRR-associated mutations do not consistently predict the response to PARPi. Considering alternative methods to define Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)—the inability to repair double strand breaks—may aid in identifying additional tumors that are sensitive to PARPi. Here, we evaluate the relationship between HRD status and HRR mutations amongst a large cohort of patients with prostate cancer. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 1,022 de-identified patients with prostate cancer that underwent next generation sequencing (NGS) with the Tempus|xT assay (DNA-seq of 648 genes at 500x coverage, whole-exome capture RNA-seq) was performed. Comparison groups were defined based on HRR alterations—either mono- or bi-allelic alterations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2), ATM, or other HRR pathway genes. HRD status was determined via the Tempus RNA-based HRD algorithm. Results: Among this cohort, mono (-/+) or biallelic (-/-) alterations of HRR genes were found in 432 patients: BRCA1/2 -/- (n = 31), BRCA1/2 -/+ (n = 87), ATM-/- (n = 24), ATM-/+ (n = 67), other HRR-/- (n = 54), other HRR-/+ (n = 169) or no HRR alterations (n = 590). The BRCA1/2-/- group had a higher frequency of Asians (17% vs. < 7% in all other groups) and were diagnosed at younger ages (median 62 years vs. > 65 for all other groups). We identified 130/1022 (13%) patients with prostate cancer to be HRD-positive (HRD+) and observed significant differences in HRD positivity according to the type of HRR alteration observed (Table). Notably, 54% (70/130) of HRD+ patients had no mutations in any genes associated with the HRR pathway. Conversely, 89% (278/314) of patients with non-BRCA1/2 HRR mutations were HRD negative. Amongst all individuals with biallelic loss of any HRR gene, HRD positivity was most enriched for BRCA2-/- (16/29, p < 0.001) and PALB2-/- (3/4, p = 0.082). Conclusions: By using an RNA-based HRD algorithm, we found 13% of patients with prostate cancer are HRD+. This RNA-based HRD signature not only captures patients with HRR mutations but also identifies a substantial population of HRD+ patients who are currently undetectable by methods based solely on sequencing HRR genes. Further research is needed to assess the clinical response to PARPi in this HRD+ population, as well as the response to PARPi in the HRD negative population who harbor HRR gene alterations.OverallN = 1,022BRCA1/2-/-N = 31BRCA1/2-/+N = 87ATM-/-N = 24ATM-/+N = 67Other HRR-/-N = 54Other HRR-/+N = 169No HRR AlterationsN = 590HRD ResultsNegative892 (100%)15 (1.7%)79 (8.9%)21 (2.4%)58 (6.5%)46 (5.2%)153 (17%)520 (58%)Positive130 (100%)16 (12%)8 (6%)3 (2.3%)9 (6.9%)8 (6.2%)16 (12%)70 (54%)  ',\n",

       "  '152Background: Accurate monitoring response of bone mets to treatment is an active need for mCRPC patients (pts). Recently, ctDNA has been showed as an early biomarker efficacy of androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) therapy for mCRPC (Conteduca, Br J Cancer 2020). In this study, we aimed to reveal if ctDNA analysis can permit more reliable prediction of bone mets burden and radiographic progression disease (PD). Methods: In a biomarker study (REC 2192/2013), targeted next generation sequencing was performed to assess ctDNA fraction. Radiographic evidence of bone disease was documented by conventional imaging according to PCWG3 criteria (Scher, J Clin Oncol 2018), and was classified on the basis of mets number (≤5, 6 -19, ≥20) in oligometastatic (O), diffuse (D), and widespread (W), respectively. Associations were explored both through uni/multivariate logistic regressions. Results: Serial plasma samples and radiographic scans on ARSI treatment were prospectively collected from 73 CRPC with bone mets. Median age was 74 years [interquartile range (IQR) 69-79]. Bone mets patterns were significantly associated with median baseline ctDNA level (O = 0.16, D = 0.33, and W = 0.46, p 0.0003). Similar results were reported on treatment and at PD (p 0.0003 and p 0.0007, respectively). In 24 pts with a progressive worsening of bone mets pattern (O→D→W) compared to pts with no change in bone mets pattern on ARSI, we observed an early meaningful ctDNA rise with a % ctDNA variation from baseline to 3 month therapy of 150.6% (IQR 104.9-210.7) vs 11.1% (IQR 0-36.6), p < 0.0001. Univariate analysis showed that early ctDNA rise was significantly associated with radiographic progression free/overall survival (rPFS/OS): hazard ratio (HR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-3.27, p 0.002, and HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15-2.88, p 0.01, respectively]. In multivariable analyses including ctDNA variation, changing bone mets pattern, age, performance status, and presence of concomitant visceral mets, ctDNA change at 3 month ARSI resulted the only independent predictor of both rPFS/OS (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.04-4.94, p 0.027 and HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.31-6.81, p 0.033, respectively). Visceral mets were associated with only OS (HR 3.87, 95% CI 1.76-8.51, p 0.0008). Conclusions: Early ctDNA variation may reflect changes in bone mets pattern on ARSI allowing to track pattern of bone progression and predict outcome. Further studies to validate these findings are warranted.',\n",

       "  '153Background: The prognostic significance of DDR alterations in mCRPC remains unclear, with conflicting data from prior reports. Whether DDR alterations are predictive of outcomes with therapeutic agents other than PARP inhibitors in mCRPC is also poorly understood. With increasing use of molecular profiling in mCRPC, understanding the full prognostic and predictive utility of plasma DDR alterations is paramount. Methods: A next-generation sequencing Predicine liquid biopsy assay was used to profile cfDNA and germline DNA in 407 mCRPC patients (pts) from two independent international cohorts (n=162 Australia, n=245 US). DDR genes profiled were BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, MLH1 and MSH2. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between DDR alterations and clinical outcomes including PSA response rate (PSA RR), progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Results: Median age was 74 (IQR 67-79), with median follow up 74 months and median OS 23 months. 65/407 (16%) harboured pathogenic DDR alterations, including 21 patients with ³1 alteration. Frequency of genomic aberrations are shown in the table. BRCA2 alterations were further classified as heterozygous loss (66%), homozygous loss (14%), monoallelic mutation (11%) and biallelic mutation/loss of heterozygosity (9%). Aberrations in any DDR gene, ATM, MLH1 + MSH2 or BRCA2 were associated with shorter OS on univariable analysis, but only any DDR or BRCA2 aberration remained significant upon adjusting for clinical prognosticators and ctDNA fraction (Table). Pre-treatment BRCA2 aberration was associated with significantly shorter OS and lower PSA RR compared to BRCA2 wt for pts receiving an AR pathway inhibitor (ARPI) (18 vs 32 months, p=0.006; 36 vs 60%, p=0.04 respectively) but not for taxane chemotherapy (17 vs 20 months, p=0.3; 45 vs 66, p=0.1 respectively). Conclusions: Detection of an aberration in any DDR gene or BRCA2 was an independent poor prognostic factor across 2 large independent cohorts of mCRPC patients. Intriguingly, patients with a BRCA2 alteration appeared to have worse outcomes with ARPI but not chemotherapy, suggesting predictive utility of DDR profiling.

       "  '154Background: Elevated circulating sphingolipids are associated with poorer outcomes across the natural history of prostate cancer (PC), including metastatic relapse in localised PC, earlier androgen deprivation failure in metastatic hormone-sensitive PC, and shorter overall survival (OS) in mCRPC. We have derived and validated a poor prognostic 3-lipid signature (3LS) [consisting of ceramide Cer(d18:1/24:1), sphingomyelin SM(d18:2/16:0) and phosphatidylcholine PC(16:0/16:0)], which was independently associated with shorter radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and OS in men with mCRPC commencing taxanes or androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI). Statins significantly reduce plasma levels of ceramides, sphingomyelin and cholesterol in cardiovascular disease. We hypothesised that this therapy could change the poor prognostic lipid profile of patients with mCRPC. This study assessed whether the addition of simvastatin to standard treatment for mCRPC modulates the circulating lipidomic profile. Methods: This investigator-initiated, multi-centre, single arm, pilot study enrolled men with mCRPC commencing taxanes or ARSI for disease progression, who were not on a lipid-lowering agent. Men were treated with simvastatin 40mg orally once daily for 12 weeks, commencing on day 1 of treatment for mCRPC. Plasma was taken at baseline and after 12 weeks of simvastatin, and underwent lipidomic profiling of ̃800 lipids. Differences in lipid levels between baseline and post-simvastatin samples and between those with and without the 3LS were assessed using t-tests. Results: 27 men (74% on taxanes, 26% on ARSI) were recruited between May 2018 to March 2021. 46% of the men had the poor prognostic 3LS at baseline, of whom 45% lost the 3LS after simvastatin. Comparison between all paired baseline and post-simvastatin samples showed significant reduction (p < 0.05) in free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters and some sphingolipids (sphingomyelins, hexosylceramides) with simvastatin treatment. Baseline profiles with the 3LS displayed significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) of ceramides, hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins, relative to baseline profiles without the 3LS. Men who lost the 3LS after treatment (n = 5) demonstrated significant reductions in ceramides (23-45%, p≤0.046), hexosylceramides (27-52%, p≤0.049) and sphingomyelins (28-44%, p≤0.047). These changes were not seen in men with persistent 3LS after treatment (n = 6). Conclusions: Simvastatin in addition to standard treatment for mCRPC can modulate the circulating lipidomic profile and eliminate the presence of a poor prognostic 3LS in 45% of participants with the 3LS. Further prospective randomised control studies are required to determine if modulation of the 3LS by simvastatin can improve clinical outcomes. Clinical trial information: ACTRN12617000965303.',\n",

       "  '155Background: Early detection of prostate cancer to reduce mortality remains controversial because there is often also overdiagnosis of low-risk disease and unnecessary treatment. Genetic scores may provide an objective measure of a man’s risk of dying from prostate cancer and thus inform screening decisions. This might be especially useful in men of African ancestry, who have a higher average risk of prostate cancer death but are often treated as a homogeneous group. Our object was to determine whether a polygenic hazard score based on 290 genetic variants (PHS290) is associated with risk of metastatic or fatal prostate cancer in a racially and ethnically diverse population. Methods: We analyzed the Million Veteran Program (MVP), a multi-ancestry population of over 500,000 individuals participating in the VA healthcare system. Genotype data were used to calculate the genetic score, PHS290. Family history of prostate cancer (first-degree relative) and ancestry group (harmonized genetic ancestry and self-reported race/ethnicity: European, African, Hispanic, or Asian) were also studied. The primary outcome studied was age at death from prostate cancer. The key secondary outcome was age at diagnosis of prostate cancer metastases. Cox regression was used to test associations. Results: 513,997 MVP participants were included. Median age at last follow-up: 69 years. PHS290 was associated with age at death from prostate cancer in the full cohort and for each ancestry group (p <10-16). Comparing men in the highest 20% of PHS290 to those in the lowest 20%, the hazard ratio (HR80/20) for death from prostate cancer was 4.41 [95% CI: 3.9-5.02]. Corresponding hazard ratios for European, African, Hispanic, and Asian subsets were 4.26 [3.66-4.9], 2.4 [1.77-3.23], 4.72 [2.68-8.87], and 10.46 [2.01-101.0]. When accounting for family history and ancestry group, PHS290 remained a strong independent predictor of fatal prostate cancer (Table). PHS290 was also associated with metastasis. PHS290 was higher, on average, among men with African ancestry. Conclusions: PHS290 stratified US veterans of diverse ancestry for lifetime risk of metastatic or fatal prostate cancer. Predicting genetic risk of lethal prostate cancer with PHS290 might inform individualized decisions about prostate cancer screening.Multivariable model: [95% confidence interval].PHS290AncestryFamily HistoryEndpointHR80/20AfricanHispanicAsianProstate Cancer5.66 [5.48-5.84]***1.84 [1.79-1.9]***1.06 [1.01-1.12]*1.25 [1.1-1.42]*1.9 [1.84-1.97]***Metastatic4.18 [3.84-4.53]***2.27 [2.09-2.46]***1.3 [1.1-1.5]1.42 [0.88-2.01]1.52 [1.39-1.69]*Fatal4.15 [3.59-4.83]***1.97 [1.67-2.29]***0.97 [0.69-1.32]*0.69 [0.17-1.45]1.67 [1.4-1.99]* * (p <0.01). *** (p <10-16).',\n",

       "  '156Background: NEPC is a high-grade aggressive form of prostate cancer. We queried whether RB1 mutation status would impact the genomic features of NEPC. We hypothesized that there would be differences in GA frequencies in RB1 mutated vs non mutated cases. Methods: From a series of 13,496 cases of clinically advanced PC, 415 (3.1%) histologically defined NEPC were sequenced using a hybrid capture-based FDA-approved clinical genomic profiling (CGP) assay to detect all classes of genomic alterations (GA). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 95 loci. PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3) with low tumor cell positive staining 1-49% and high staining ≥50% expression. Results: 253 (61%) of NEPC feature GA in RB1 (RB1 mut+). This contrasts with a 5.8% frequency of RB1 GA in the non-NEPC (P <.0001). The RB1 mut+ NEPC featured a slightly greater number of driver GA/tumor than the RB1 mut- NEPC (5.1 vs 4.2). Age and TMPRSS2-ERG fusion frequency were similar between the groups. RB1 Mut- NEPC was associated with significantly higher amplifications (amp) and total GA in AR compared to RB1 mut+ NEPC. RB1 mut+ NEPC featured significantly greater frequency of PTEN GA. GA frequencies in targetable kinases and DNA repair GA including BRCA1/2 and ATM linked to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) response were similar in both groups. For potential immune-oncology (IO) biomarkers, RB1 Mut+ NEPC featured significantly greater frequency of low positive PD-L1 expression and lower frequencies of MDM2 and CDK12 GA. CD274 (PD-L1) amplification, MSI-high status and cases with TMB ≥10 mut/Mb were very uncommon in both groups. Conclusions: In NEPC, the presence of RB1 mutation is associated with various GA that may have clinical relevance. Limitations include possible selection and confounding biases, and lack of clinical annotation. Further study of RB1 status as a guide of trial designs on therapy selection for men with NEPC is warranted.NEPCRB1 mut+ (253 cases)RB1 mut- (162 cases)P ValueAR total GA5.1%14.2%0.002TP5368.0%58.0%0.02PTEN43.1%25.9%0.0004PIK3CA5.5%4.9%NSCD2740.4%1.3%NSMSI High/TMB≥10mut/Mb1.6%/8.6%1.9%/6.0%NSTMB≥10/20 mut/Mb8.6%/3.0%6.0%/2.0%NSPD-L1 Low/High Positive28.6%/4.7% (64 cases)6%/4.1% (49 cases)0.003 ',\n",

       "  '157Background: TALAPRO-1 enrolled men with progressive mCRPC with measurable soft-tissue disease and tumor DDRm involved directly or indirectly in homologous recombination repair (HRR) (11 gene panel). These men had received 1–2 taxane chemotherapy and progressed on ≥1 novel hormonal therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate ([ORR] per RECIST 1.1; central review). Exploratory ad hoc biomarker analyses assessed germline DDR/HRR (gHRR) alteration landscape and associations with antitumor activity. Methods: Alterations were defined as known/likely pathogenic variants. gHRR alteration (gHRRm) frequency was assessed in the study population evaluable for saliva sequencing (n = 91) using Ambry CustomNext-Cancer (9/11 genes from the tumor panel assessed). Potential associations between gHRRm status and antitumor activity were explored in the HRR-deficient measurable disease population evaluable for gHRRm (n = 70). The potential association of germline vs somatic tumor HRRm and antitumor activity was also assessed in the HRR-deficient measurable disease population (n = 104) using saliva data and somatic-germline-zygosity (SGZ) prediction (when saliva results were unavailable) to annotate tumor alteration origin. This analysis was limited to short variants. Data cutoff was Sept 4, 2020 (primary completion date). Results: Using Ambry saliva results, 19 gHRRm were identified in 18/91 (20%) evaluable patients (pts) (BRCA2 = 10; ATM = 4; CHEK2 = 4; RAD51C = 1; 1 pt had both ATM and RAD51C). As expected for germline sequencing, all 19 alterations were short variants (12 SNV, 7 InDels). For 17/19 gHRRm, central lab tumor F1CDx records were available: in all 17 cases, identical tumor alterations were found. Of these 17 tumor HRRm, 16 were evaluable for tumor SGZ prediction of origin or zygosity: 15/16 germline, with 1/16 somatic; 9/16 homozygous (incl 7/9 BRCA2), with 7/16 heterozygous (incl 2/9 BRCA2). ORR was 31% (5/16) in men with gHRRm and 26% (14/54) in men without gHRRm (P = 0.7519, 2-sided Fisher exact test). Based on tumor sequencing results, annotated using saliva results and SGZ predictions, ORR was 25% (10/40) in men with gHRRm and 19% (4/21) in men with only somatic HRRm (P = 0.7528). Conclusions: Here we report a 20% incidence of gHRRm for this population of men with mCRPC preselected based on tumor HRRm status, which may be impacted by low Ns and assay specific differences in variant calling. In this population, no association with differential antitumor activity was observed with gHRRm status as assessed using germline results alone, or assessed holistically using a combination of tumor and saliva results and SGZ prediction.',\n",

       "  '158Background: Early clinical responses to anti-PSMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CARs) have been observed but much like the leukemia experience, significant toxicity from macrophage activation (MAS) has also been observed Building on our experience with a first in-human armoured CAR (TmPSMA-01) targeting PSMA (with a 41BB and CD3 endodomain) coupled with a dominant-negative TGFBR2 module, where we observed anti-tumor effects but also immune-mediated toxicity, we designed a CAR with additional armour, a PD1-CD28 switch, to overcome the immune suppressive microenvironment and further improve efficacy. We successfully built tricistronic constructs that expresses the CAR, a dnTGFBR2 module and a switch receptor for PD1 and CD28. We compared the 41BB endodomain and the CD2 domain, which has shown preliminary effects reducing cytokine release. We hypothesized that these changes would increase efficacy in immune-suppressive solid tumors while reducing excessive cytokine release and untoward immune toxicity. Methods: CAR constructs were synthesized into a self-inactivating lentiviral backbone and CAR T cells manufactured comprising a control TmPSMA-01 construct and two primary constructs: PSMA-CD2z:dnTGFBR:PD1-CD28 and PSMA-41BBz:dnTGFBR:PD1-CD28. Expression of the CAR as well as T cell markers were determined by flow cytometry, and CAR affinity for target by Lumicks. CAR activation and cytotoxicity were assessed by ELISPOT, xCelligence and Celligo standard assays. A co-culture macrophage activation system was applied to each construct to assess the potential of each construct to induce MAS-like responses. Results: A significant difference was seen in the MFI of the CAR, with the CD2 based CAR consistently ̃50% lower than the 41BB and this correlated to a faster off-rate from target cells measured by Lumicks. There was no difference in exhaustion or memory markers, and cytotoxicity across a range of E:T ratios was equivalent between the CD2 and 41BB constructs. Preliminary data indicated the CD2 endodomain preserved T cell activation but with lower cytokine release. The CD2 constructs consistently produced significantly less total IL2 and IFNg after exposure to targets, yet had similar numbers of ELISPOT positive cells for IL2 and IFNg indicating less cytokine production per kill. This also resulted in significantly less macrophage based cytokines such as IL6 and IL8 in the coculture model. Using a cell line knocked out for PDL1/2 and then reengineered for constitutive PDL1/2 expression, we demonstrated improved speed of killing in the xCelligence system dependent on the PD1:CD28 switch but no increase in cytokine release. Conclusions: A CD2 based endodomain tricistronic CAR targeting PSMA (TmPSMA-02) maintained cytotoxicity, memory profile and activation while having a significantly reduced risk of inducing macrophage activation.',\n",

       "  '159Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard of care for high-risk prostate cancer, but treatment tolerance is variable. Prior work has demonstrated the correlation between body composition (BC) and clinical outcomes in prostate cancer. Specifically, high visceral fat density has been associated with fat depletion phenomenon and poor prognosis in prostate cancer. However, the interaction of long-term ADT tolerance and body fat composition is less studied. We investigated if BC could predict for outcomes and treatment tolerance in patients with high-risk prostate cancer with planned ADT. Methods: An IRB-approved retrospective review was conducted at a tertiary care center of patients with high-risk (T3a or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] > 20 ng/mL or Gleason score 8-10 or N/M+) prostate cancer who received definitive external beam radiation therapy (RT) from 2006 to 2013. A previously validated, fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was performed on RT simulation scans to compute BC at the top of L3 slice, including total skeletal muscle (SM), subcutaneous fat (SF), and visceral fat (VF) surface area (cm2) and average CT density (Hounsfield Units (HU)); results were manually validated by experts. BC was stratified by median value. Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE) was used to measure co-morbidity. Long-term ADT was defined as > 2 years, tolerance was defined as unplanned discontinuation > 3-month difference in intended/actual duration of ADT. The association between BC markers, oncologic outcomes, and treatment tolerance was analyzed using univariable Cox regression and chi-square test. Results: A total of 207 men were analyzed with a median follow up time of 10.8 years (range 0.7-17.3y). Median age was 65 (range 42-83), with 61 (29.4%) patients classified as high-risk, 134 (64.7%) very-high-risk, and 12 (5.8%) N+/M+ at diagnosis. High VF density was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (HR 1.71, 95%CI 1.09-2.68, p = 0.0204) but not cancer-specific survival (CSS) (p = 0.08) or biochemical-relapse free survival (bRFS) (p = 0.97). SM and SF density, as well as area of SM, VF, SF, and total fat were not associated with outcomes. N/M stage was associated with bRFS (p = 0.0139), and N/M stage (p = 0.0101) and higher ACE score (p = 0.0218) were associated with OS. Among 88 (42.5%) patients planned for long-term ADT use, 24 (27%) patients discontinued ADT prior to duration, of which 15 (17%) patients discontinued due to toxicity. BC markers did not correlate with tolerance to long-term ADT (p = 0.17). Tolerance to long-term ADT was not associated with bRFS or OS. Conclusions: High VF density is associated with worse OS but not bRFS or CSS in high-risk prostate cancer patients, and not associated with adipose area or ADT tolerance. VF density may be a biomarker of underlying metabolic health in prostate cancer patients independent of disease, and a potential area of intervention.',\n",

       "  '160Background: Oral AA is a standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer. The recommended daily AA 1000 mg dose produces high peak and low trough plasma concentrations that are associated with safety issues (e.g., hepatotoxicity) and inadequate efficacy, respectively. PRL-02 is a novel abiraterone prodrug undergoing evaluation in patients with advanced prostate cancer (NCT04729114). In chemically-castrate monkeys, single doses of PRL-02 suppressed androgens for 14 weeks at much lower plasma exposures than AA (Moore et\\xa0al, ASCO GU 2021). The present study in intact male rats evaluated the systemic exposures and activity of PRL-02 compared to daily oral AA at 7 and/or 14 days post-treatment start. Methods: Sexually mature male rats (n=4 per timepoint) were administered a single IM dose of PRL-02 (90 mg/kg), daily AA (90 mg/kg) or IM/oral vehicle (VEH). Biological samples were collected on Day 7 (PRL-02/VEH; 0h) or Day 14 (PRL-02/AA/VEH; 2, 6 and 24h) post-dosing. Drug and androgen concentrations were determined by LC-MS/MS. Testicular CYP17 hydroxylase activity was measured ex vivo on Day 14. Results: The Day 14 plasma exposure from abiraterone was greater from AA (5.6 - 210 ng/mL) than from PRL-02 (1.15 – 1.37 ng/mL). However, for Day 14 tissue exposures (AUC0-24) from ‘total abiraterone equivalents’ (TAE; concentration of free abiraterone plus abiraterone from prodrug) were greater from PRL-02 in adrenal, testes, lymph node and bone target tissues than from oral AA; exposures from AA were only greater in non-target tissues such as liver and brain (Table). There was no measurable Day 14 CYP17 hydroxylase activity in testes following PRL-02 or AA dosing; inhibition appeared irreversible from PRL-02 and AA. Compared to VEH, a single IM dose of PRL-02 resulted in 81% and 75% reductions in plasma testosterone (T) on Days 7 and 14 post-dose, and an 80% reduction in testicular T on Day 14. Daily AA resulted in a 98% reduction in plasma T after 14 days. Conclusions: Single-dose IM PRL-02 blocked testicular CYP17 enzyme activity as effectively as daily AA in intact male rats and produced a durable large reduction in plasma T. The pharmacological activity, tissue and plasma distribution of TAE from IM PRL-02 in the rat model, along with results from prior monkey model studies, suggest the potential for a greater therapeutic index than from daily oral AA and support the ongoing evaluation of IM PRL-02 in patients with advanced prostate cancer.IM PRL-02PO AATissueCmax (ng/mL)AUC0-24 (ng.h/mL)Cmax (ng/mL)AUC0-24 (ng.h/mL)Adrenal1,43611,7501,37811,368Inguinal lymph node11,02971,6613,15532,872Femur1189801,360,4072912,670Testes61612,0541361,865Brain295972,86726,765Liver1442,3382,85142,052  ',\n",

       "  '161Background: TMPRSS2 is one of the two key enzymes that SARS-CoV-2 requires for its entry to the cell. TMPRSS2 is regulated by androgen receptor. It is well described Androgen Receptor Directed Therapy (ARDT) downregulates the expression of TMPRSS2. We hypothesized that the ARDT has a protective role in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) from poor outcome of COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective chart review of PCa patients with COVID-19 between March to October 2020 in the Yale-New Haven Health System was performed. Demographics, comorbidities, home medications, laboratory data, treatment, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were collected. ARDT was defined as the use of GnRH agonist, GnRH antagonist, or androgen receptor antagonist. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Yale University. Results: A total of 146 (1.1%) prostate cancer cases were identified from the 13,642 cases of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics are summarized in the table. Twenty-five (17%) were on active ARDT and 121 (83%) not on ARDT (non-ARDT). The rates of hospitalization were the same: 52%, between the ARDT and non-ARDT group. Of those admitted, mean duration of hospitalization were 9.2 days (Range 1-25) and 14.9 days (Range: 2-47) in ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.14). Rates of hospital stay >30 days were 0% versus 14.3% (9/63) in ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.15). Intubation rates were 0% versus 11% (7/63) for ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.21). Mortality rates were 8% and 13.2%, in ARDT and non-ARDT groups, respectively (p=0.47). Conclusions: The prevalence of PCa was infrequent. Despite advanced stage of the cancer in ARDT group, there was a trend toward decreased severity of COVID-19 and mortality rates compared to non-ARDT group.

To date, no study has compared the treatment class-specific outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) on Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICPI) vs. taxane chemotherapy by tumor mutational burden (TMB, mutations/megabase). Methods: Association of genomic data with clinical variables and outcomes in cohort of patients with mCRPC treated January 2011- April 2021. Longitudinal de-identified clinical data from ̃280 U.S. academic or community-based cancer clinics were derived from electronic health records, curated via technology-enabled abstraction by Flatiron Health and linked to genomic testing by Foundation Medicine (FoundationOne or FoundationOne CDx assays). 45 patients (14 with TMB ≥ 10, 31 TMB < 10) received single-agent anti-PD1 axis ICPI, 696 (30 with TMB ≥ 10, 666 TMB < 10) received single-agent taxanes, at discretion of physician without randomization. For time to next therapy (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) assessments, imbalances between treatment groups were adjusted with propensity weighting. Results: Overall cohort: Median age: 70 (IQR: 64 – 76), median PSA: 79.4 (IQR: 19.0 – 254), 108 (18.8%) were ECOG 2+, 644 (86.9%) had received prior systemic treatments for mCRPC. Patients receiving ICPI vs. taxanes had comparable pre-therapy age, PSA, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, prior second generation novel hormonal therapy use, and prior opioid use, but higher TMB (median 3.5, IQR: 1.7 – 15 vs. median 2.5, IQR 1.3 – 3.8, p < 0.001), higher ECOG scores (0, 1, 2+ respectively 13.9%, 55.6%, 30.6% vs. 29.4%, 52.6%, 18.8%, p = 0.057), and greater prior taxane use (73.3% vs. 53.7%, p = 0.01). Among patients with evaluable PSA response, no difference was observed on taxanes by TMB level. No patients had PSA decline ≥ 50% on ICPI if TMB < 10, 4 of 9 with TMB ≥ 10 had PSA decline ≥ 50%. TMB < 10 receiving ICPI vs. taxanes had worse TTNT (median 2.4 vs. 4.1 months; HR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.7 – 4.0, p < 0.001) and numerically worse OS (median 4.2 vs. 6.0 months, HR: 1.08; 95%CI: 0.68– 1.7, p = 0.73). In contrast, for TMB ≥ 10 ICPI vs. taxane use was associated with more favorable TTNT (median 8.0 vs. 2.4 months; HR: 0.37, 95%CI: 0.15 – 0.87, p = 0.022) and OS (median 19.9 vs. 4.2 months; HR: 0.23, 95%CI: 0.10 – 0.57, p = 0.0085). Among all 741 patients, 44 had TMB ≥ 10, 22 had high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), 20 had both. Treatment interactions with TMB ≥ 10 (TTNT: p < 0.001, OS: p = 0.021) were stronger than MSI-H (TTNT: p = 0.0038, OS: p = 0.080). Conclusions: The results suggest ICPI may be a viable alternative to taxane chemotherapy for patients with mCRPC with TMB ≥ 10, adding validity to existing FDA approved platform and pan-tumor TMB score cutoff of 10.',\n",

       "  '163Background: Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) do not derive benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) affects up to 30% of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and is predictive of response to PARP inhibitors. The potential activity of ICI in this subset of patients is unknown and the tumour microenvironment (TME) associated with HRD is poorly understood. We used mPCa tumours of patients with known HRD alterations as a model to study clinically relevant, therapeutically targetable drivers of tumour immunology. Methods: Archival tumor tissue of patients with known germline or somatic HRD alterations enrolled in our institutional GU Biobank (n = 13) was used for immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of the following immune markers in both tumour cells (TC) and stromal lymphocytes (SL): CD8, adenosine receptor 2a (A2aR), GAL9, IL-2, LAG3, PD-L2, and TIM-3. The same markers were analyzed in untreated (n = 104), and neoadjuvant hormone therapy treated (NHT) (n = 16) tissue. Two-tailed t-test and Pearson R correlations were performed for analysis. Results: Among screened HRD alterations, BRCA1/2 were the most frequently identified (BRCA1/2 n = 6, FANCC n = 1, FANCD2 n = 2, PALB2 n = 1, CDK12 n = 1, ATR n = 2). CD8+ cells were primarily localized in the stroma of HRD cohort specimens rather than in the glandular epithelia. The HRD cohort had higher levels of A2aR, in TC and SL (p≤0.0001 for both). When compared to the untreated cohort, PD-L2 levels were higher in SL of the HRD cohort (p≤0.05) while lower in the TC (p≤0.01). Lower levels of LAG3 were found in the HRD cohort TC compared to NHT cohort (p≤0.01). There were significantly lower levels of GAL9 in the TC of the HRD cohort compared to untreated (p < 0.0001) tumours. There were no differences in TIM-3 levels between the cohorts. Conclusions: Evaluation of stromal and tumour cell immune profiling indicates that compared to other subtypes, mPCa with HRD alteration have a unique immune profile abundant in CD8+ cell, and high in PD-L2 and A2aR expression. Not only does this indicate an immune active TME but also identifies therapeutically actionable pathways which may render clinical benefit in this patient population.',\n",

       "  '164Background: Novel treatments for clinically advanced GUca including castrate resistant prostate ca (PC), bladder urothelial ca (BUC) and clear cell renal ca (ccRCC) are widely needed. Recently, the targeting of cancer cells with arginine accumulation caused by MTAP loss has emerged as a new synthetic lethality-based anti-cancer program. Methods: 8,436 mCRPC, 2,683 BUC and 841 ccRCC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on up to 114 loci. PD-L1 tumor cell expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). Results: 1.3% of PC, 24.2% of BUC and 5.5% of ccRCC featured MTAP loss. There were no significant age or gender differences associated with MTAP loss. CDKN2A/B loss ranged from 94% in ccRCC to > 99% in PC and BUC. The GA/tumor frequencies were similar when CDKN2A/B GA are excluded. In PC, GA in TP53, PTEN and BRCA1 were more frequent, while GA in AR, CDK12, RB1 and BRCA2 were less frequent in cases with MTAP loss. In BUC, GA in TSC1 and FGFR3 were more frequent and GA in RB1and TP53 were less frequent in cases with MTAP loss. In ccRCC, GA in NF2 were more frequent in cases with MTAP loss, while GA in VHL and PBRM1 were less frequent in cases with MTAP loss. “Targetable” kinase GA were rare in all groups, except for FGFR3 GA in MTAP loss BUC. Immunotherapy (IO) putative biomarkers varied among tumors, with MSI-high status less frequent and TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb more frequent in BUC MTAP-intact than BUC with MTAP loss. PD-L1 expression was similar except for high PD-L1 expression more frequent in MTAP-intact BUC. Conclusions: When compared with PC and ccRCC, the clinical development of novel drugs, such as PRMT5 and MTA2 inhibitors in GUca will likely be focused on BUC given the 24% frequency of MTAP loss in that tumor type. CGP of PC, BUC and ccRCC reveal significant differences in GA in MTAP-intact and tumors with MTAP loss, which may impact future combinatorial clinical trial designs.Prostate CarcinomaBladder CarcinomaClear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma1.3% MTAP Loss24.2% MTAP Loss5.5% MTAP LossPC MTAP Intact (8326)PCMTAP Loss (110)P ValueUBC MTAP Intact(2033)UBC MTAP Loss(650)P ValueccRCC MTAP Intact(795)ccRCC MTAPLoss(46)P ValuePTEN30.5%48.2%=.00024%6%NS20%12%NSTSC10.2%0%NS7%26%<.00014%6%NSFGFR30.1%0%NS13%33%<.00010.1%0.1%NSMSI High2.8%0.9%NS1%1%NS0%0%NSMean TMB2.63.8=.000211.28.5P <.00012.92.2NSTMB≥10 mut/Mb5.8%3.6%NS41%30%P <.00011%0%NS ',\n",

       "  '165Background: A prior study of patients with advanced cancers treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) associated improved overall survival with tissue tumor mutational burden above the 80th percentile in each histology (tTMB-H). TMB can also reliably be calculated via liquid biopsy (bTMB), and trends higher than tTMB in analogous tumors. Here, we generate a plasma-informed benchmark for bTMB-H in advanced prostate cancer and report preliminary data from an ongoing multi-institutional case series of patients treated with ICI. Methods: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) next generation sequencing (NGS) results from 3,504 patients with advanced prostate cancer who received a Guardant360 liquid biopsy within a 12-month period were analyzed. The 80th percentile of TMB was defined as the benchmark for bTMB-H in this cohort, and prevalence of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) was determined. Subsequently, clinical data were collected from patients across five institutions who received pembrolizumab based on bTMB scores or other tumor characteristics (i.e. CDK12 mutation). Results: Overall, mean and median bTMB were calculated as 12.34 mut/Mb and 8.61 mut/Mb, respectively (range: 0 – 1164.75 mut/Mb). The 80th percentile of bTMB was 13.4 mut/Mb and the 90th percentile was 16.6 mut/Mb. 2.6% of patients were both MSI-H and bTMB-H. No patients with bTMB < 13.4 mut/Mb (TMB-L) were found to be MSI-H. Ten patients from five institutions received pembrolizumab (8 monotherapy) after a median of 4.5 lines of prior therapy (Table). Four patients were MSI-H. The 3 patients in the cohort with PSA decreases > 50% had both MSI-H and bTMB ≥ 13.4 mut/Mb. Per RECIST criteria, disease was controlled (CR, PR, SD) in 6 of 7 (86%) patients with bTMB scores ≥ 13.4 mut/Mb. Conclusions: These data continue to affirm that ctDNA NGS is a practical and cost-effective means of assessing potential predictors of ICI activity in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Preliminary data from this growing cohort of patients who have received ICI guided by bTMB scores and other molecular parameters identified via ctDNA NGS, including MSI-H, demonstrate a clinical benefit from therapy. Further studies are warranted for contextualizing individual tumor bTMB scores with established, pathology-specific benchmarks.PatientAgebTMB (mut/Mb)Days from G360 to start of ICIPre- ICI PSADays on ICI (ongoing*)Decrease in PSA >50%ORR16536.3635700.5353*N/APR270184.49130.01134*N/APR36759.821510.255*YesN/A47316.59397.576*NoSD56513.41212563*NoSD6833.83486.7564N/APD78119.332014.53131YesPR88814.351217.2221YesPR97424.844292.363NoPD10639.57731.824NoN/A ',\n",

       "  '166Background: 177Lutetium PSMA-617 (LuPSMA) is an effective therapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, treatment resistance may occur. We developed a quantitative workflow for serial PSMA PET/CT to optimise predictive and prognostic imaging biomarker capability for progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods: 56 men with mCRPC previously treated with taxane chemotherapy and androgen signaling inhibitor were enrolled, receiving up to 6 doses of LuPSMA and a radiation sensitizer idronoxil (NOX66). 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was performed at study entry and exit. Traffic Light (TL) quantification workflow was developed to track changes in both tumour volume and intensity at a total body and lesional level. Lesions were classified as responding in green (>30% decline in volume), stable in yellow (<30% change in volume/intensity), progressive in red (>30% increase in volume/intensity, or new). Overall response pattern was categorised as responding (green/yellow), low volume red (<50% progressive disease) or high volume red (>50% progressive disease). TL workflow results were correlated with PFS and OS. Results: 37/56 men underwent both entry and exit imaging. The median PSA decline was 77% (IQR 34-92%), and 70% (26/37) achieved PSA response >50%. PSA progression occurred in 54% (20/37) at exit imaging. Median PFS was 8.6 months (95%CI 5.6-11.6) and median OS 22 months (95% CI 18.6-25.6). 95% (35/37) had reduction in PSMA SUVmax (-26.1 (IQR +11.7 to -89.4)) and SUVmean (-3.3 (+2.9 to -14.2)). PSMA total tumor volume reduced in 68% (25/37) (median -0.64 liters (range +1.44 to -1.1)). On TL workflow, 24% (9/37) had responding/stable disease (green/yellow), 76% (28/37) had progressive disease (red) of whom 41% (15/37) had low volume progression and 35% (13/37) high volume progression. Men with high volume progression had worse OS compared to responders (HR 0.18 (0.05-0.59), p 0.005), and low volume progression (HR 0.30 (0.11-0.80), p 0.02). 68% (19/28) had progression on both TL workflow and PSA, while 32% (9/28) had progression on TL workflow without PSA progression. In multivariable analysis, TL workflow and PSA progression at time of exit scans were independent predictors of OS (Table). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of characterizing lesional response on molecular imaging with a quantification TL workflow. TL workflow response independently correlated with survival outcomes, indicating serial PSMA PET has prognostic biomarker potential.

       "  '167Background: Low PSMA uptake on positron-emission tomography is seen in up to 30% of mCRPC pts and represents a clinically distinct subgroup with adverse outcomes. We assessed transcriptional and clinical features associated with low PSMA (FOLH1) gene expression in mCRPC. Methods: A retrospective analysis of mCRPC biopsy samples with RNA-seq data was undertaken. Normalized FOLH1 expression was compared across histologic subtypes and sites of disease. We assessed the association between FOLH1 expression, selected androgen receptor (AR) target genes, master regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation, and previously validated AR activity and treatment-associated small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (t-SCNC) transcriptional signature scores using Pearson correlations. Associations between FOLH1 and both PSA50 response to subsequent AR-targeted therapy and overall survival (OS) were examined by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Results: Samples from 97 pts were identified, of which 18% harbored t-SCNC histology. 45% of pts had visceral metastases at the time of biopsy, and 41% received subsequent AR-targeted therapy. Median FOLH1 expression was lower in pts with visceral metastases vs no visceral metastases (14.7 vs 15.6, p = 0.02) but was not significantly different across t-SCNC vs adenocarcinoma biopsies (14.3 vs 15.4, p = 0.13). FOLH1 expression was positively correlated with AR transcriptional activity and AR target genes, and negatively correlated with master regulators of neuroendocrine differentiation and t-SCNC transcriptional signature scores (Table). Low FOLH1 expression did not predict PSA50 response to subsequent AR-targeted therapy (OR 0.97, p = 0.8), but was associated with shorter OS on univariate analysis (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, p=0.01). A post-hoc analysis revealed a trend towards decreased median OS in pts with FOLH1 expression <12 (7.5 vs 17.1 months, log-rank p = 0.06). Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis of mCRPC pts, low FOLH1 expression was associated with transcriptional features of t-SCNC, decreased AR activity, and shorter OS.

       "  '168Background: Prostate cancer (PC) responds to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) usually in a transient fashion, progressing from hormone-sensitive PC (HSPC) to castration-resistant PC (CRPC). While it is recognized that ADT has an immunomodulatory effect, little is known about the intestinal microbiome effect on therapeutic outcome of ADT. Methods: We investigated a mouse model of PC as well as specimens from PC patients to unravel an unsuspected contribution of thymus-derived T lymphocytes and the intestinal microbiota in the efficacy of ADT. Preclinical experiments were performed in PC-bearing mice, immunocompetent or immunodeficient. In parallel, we prospectively included 65 HSPC and CRPC patients to analyze their feces and blood specimen. Results: In PC-bearing mice, ADT increased thymic cellularity and output. PC implanted in T lymphocyte-depleted or athymic mice responded less efficiently to ADT than in immunocompetent mice. Moreover, depletion of the intestinal microbiota by oral antibiotics reduced the efficacy of ADT. PC reduced the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut, and this effect was reversed by ADT. Moreover, cohousing of PC-bearing mice with tumor-free mice, or oral gavage with Akkermansia improved the efficacy of ADT. This appear to be applicable to PC patients because long-term ADT resulted in an increase of thymic output, as demonstrated by an increase in circulating recent thymic emigrant cells (sjTRECs). Moreover, as compared to HSPC controls, CRPC patients demonstrated a shift in their intestinal microbiota that significantly correlated with sjTRECs. While feces from healthy volunteers restored ADT efficacy. Conclusions: These findings suggest that reversing the intestinal dysbiosis and repairing acquired immune defects in PC patients have a potential impact on the therapeutic outcome of ADT.',\n",

       "  '169Background: The HRRm detection is used to prescribe PARP inhibitors in mCRPC patients. The frequency of HRR alterations has been investigated in several clinical studies, but the prevalence of HRRm in real clinical practice remains unclear. We conducted the first study to evaluate prevalence of HRRm in mCRPC patients in Russia. This interim analysis is aimed to provide HRRm rate in real practice in Russian population. Methods: Patients with mCRPC and available tumor tissue samples (FFPEs) were enrolled from October 2020 till May 2021. Samples were analyzed in 3 labs. Target enrichment using multiplex PCR and library preparation of genes involved in HRR (BRCA2, BRCA1, RAD54L, FANCL, BARD1, ATM, CHEK1, RAD51B, PALB2, RAD51D, CDK12, RAD51C, BRIP1, CHEK2) was performed using three different techniques: GeneReader NGS System (QIAGEN), KAPA HyperPlus and SeqCap EZ Choice (Roche) and in-house targeted NGS-panel. For last 2 sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina). Results: In this interim analysis we included 331 mCRPC patients from 20 sites with median age 67 years, 86,7% caucasian. Family or personal history of oncological diseases had 66 (20%) of pts 300 FFPEs were analyzed by NGS, 31 (9%) were not valid (poor quality/not enough DNA). HRRm rate is 19,7% (59/300). Most frequently mutated genes ( > 1%) listed in the table below. Other mutations (RAD51B, RAD51C, BARD1, FANCL, RAD51D, RAD54L) were detected in 1-2 cases per gene. Conclusions: This first systematic analysis of HRRm in Russian population of mCRPC patients showed general consistency with previously reported HRRm data (19,7% in our trial in comparison with 27.9% in PROfound trial).

       "  '170Background: Molecular testing for mutations in genes related to homologous recombination repair (HRR) and microsatellite instability (MSI) is suggested for patients with advanced prostate cancer by international guidelines. Recently, olaparib has been approved for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients that bear mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in Europe. In Greece, molecular testing for prostate cancer patients is not reimbursed. In this setting we describe our experience from investigating the molecular profile of patients with advanced/metastatic disease. Methods: We retrospectively collected clinicopathological data of patients treated in our center for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer whose tumours were subjected to whole exome sequencing analysis for a panel of 58 genes including BRCA1/2. All patients provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results: Tumor samples from 37 patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed. Median age of the patients was 60.2 years (25th-75th percentile 54.4-63.9 years) and most of them (19/37, 51.4%) were presented with de novo metastatic disease. Clinicopathological characteristics of the patients are presented in the table. Eight samples (21.6%) were evaluated as inadequate to perform further analysis. In the remaining 29 cases, no BRCA1/2 mutations were detected. Instead, 7 patients had mutations in HRR-related genes, including 3 patients with ATM mutations, two in CHEK2, one in CHEK1 and one in RAD50. TP53 mutations were found in 8 patients (21.6%) and PTEN mutations in 2 (5.4%). Newer Hormonal Treatments were used as first-line treatment in mCRPC in 24 patients (64.9%), while 6 received docetaxel. Median PFS in first-line mCRPC was 12.0 months (95% CI 9.7-14.3) in the whole population and did not differ significantly in patients with HRD mutations (11.8 months) or TP53 mutations (11.8 months). Two patients with ATM mutations received olaparib as fourth and fifth line of treatment respectively with stable disease as best response. Conclusions: Biomarker driven targeted therapies are currently available for mCRPC patients. In our cohort, molecular testing was negatively affected by the poor quality of archival tissues in a significant percentage of patients. However, mutations in HRR-related genes were found in almost 20% of patients with possible therapeutic implications. Therefore, it is necessary to have a reimbursed molecular testing for prostate cancer patients in Greece.CharacteristicN (%)Gleason group at diagnosis12345Missing2 (5.4%)5 (13.5%)6 (16.2%)11 (29.7%)11 (29.7%)2 (5.4%)Initial stage at diagnosisIIIIIIVMissing1 (2.7%)12 (32.4%)21(57.3%)3 (8.1%)Initial treatment of localized diseaseProstatectomyRadiotherapy and ADTADT onlyNot applicableMissing11 (29.7%)2 (5.4%)2 (5.4%)19 (51.4%)1 (2.7%) ',\n",

       "  '171Background: Patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have a variety of different systemic therapy options, yet survival outcomes remain poor. To minimize the chance of rapid resistance, it is critical to be able to personalize therapy upfront. We previously developed a cell-free DNA liquid biopsy assay that tracks alterations in the androgen receptor (AR) locus, including its upstream enhancer (EnhanceAR-Seq). This assay demonstrated the ability to stratify patients based on resistance to AR-directed agents after treatment started (Dang and Chauhan et\\xa0al., JCO PO, 2020). Here we evaluated if the same approach can accurately risk-stratify patients with mCRPC prior to the initiation of first-line AR-targeted therapy. Methods: We performed EnhanceAR-Seq on plasma cell-free DNA samples from 55 mCRPC patients prior to the initiation of AR-targeted therapy. Forty-seven patients were treated with Abiraterone and eight with Enzalutamide. Five patients were excluded due to having already received AR-targeted therapy or being lost to follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed in relation to AR/enhancer locus status (wild-type vs. altered). Results: Median follow-up time was 30 months. EnhanceAR-Seq noninvasively detected AR/enhancer locus alterations in 36% (18/50) of the patients in our cohort, while 64% (32/50) were determined to be wild-type. Alterations detected by the assay were AR amplification (12/18), AR nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (4/18), AR truncation (2/18), and AR enhancer amplification (13/18). Eleven patients had both AR gene body and enhancer amplifications present. Strikingly, patients with AR/enhancer alterations detected in plasma cell-free DNA were found to have significantly worse outcomes, with median PFS of 16.3 (wild-type) vs. 10.8 months (altered) (p = 0.046; HR = 2.10), and OS trending toward significantly different with median 34.3 (wild type) vs. 24.7 months (altered) (p = 0.19; HR = 1.05). Conclusions: AR/enhancer locus alterations in patients with mCRPC, as detected noninvasively by EnhanceAR-Seq, corresponded with significantly worse PFS and trended toward significantly worse OS. Our results support the role of cell-free DNA AR/enhancer locus alterations as prognostic, and potentially predictive, biomarkers that enable more precise upfront risk stratification and treatment personalization.',\n",

       "  '172Background: Mechanisms of tumor invasion are not well defined. PTEN, a key tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in epithelial cancers, acts as a central node that controls tumor invasion. Despite PI-3 kinase-phospho-Akt pathway activation resulting in enhanced tumor growth, prostate tumors with PTEN loss undergo p53-mediated senescence that restricts tumor invasion. Methods: ABI1 downregulation is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition in highly invasive prostate tumors; these tumors frequently loose PTEN; therefore we set to examine genetic interaction of ABI1 and PTEN using novel mouse model of prostate cancer. We analyzed the correlation of ABI1 and PTEN expression in human PCa tumor tissue. Results: Here, using Abi1/Pten KO mouse model we identified a novel mechanism that guards tumor invasion. In Pten-null tumors upregulation of Abi1 leads to sequestration of activated Src kinase. In the absence of Abi1, this regulation is lost leading to activation of non-canonical WNT-SRC-STAT3 axis and enhanced invasion through activation of MMP2 activity. This molecular mechanism explains progression of tumors with Pten loss from PIN to invasive carcinoma upon concomitant Abi1 inactivation. In human tumors with low Abi1 and Pten are associated with aggressive phenotype, biochemical recurrence and metastasis. Conclusions: ABI1 acts as failsafe mechanism in PTEN null tumors by restricting SRC-mediated tumor invasion. ABI1 might have a predictive value in clinical setting in context of PTEN levels.',\n",

       "  '173Background: Some proportion of men with CRPC have favorable responses to high doses of testosterone (HDT) and some do not. Genomic determinants of these responders and non-responders are poorly understood. Herein ctDNA predictors of response are assessed using a responder/non-responder analysis. Methods: All men with CRPC had been pretreated with abiraterone, enzalutamide, or both. A ctDNA test was obtained prior to high doses of testosterone (administered as a dose of 400 mg IM testosterone cypionate every 3-4 weeks). Guardant 360 was used to analyze ctDNA (with an allelic fraction cut-off of > 0.5%) to ascertain the presence or absence of pathogenic mutations. Lower allelic fractions were not analyzed. Responders had a PSA decline of 50% or more (N = 16), non-responders received at least two doses of testosterone but never had any PSA decline at all (N = 20). All patients were treated at Tulane Cancer Center. Results: AR amplifications were more commonly detected (p = 0.036) pre-treatment in the ctDNA of responders (5/16) as compared to non-responders (1/20). No differences were found in those with common AR mutations; T878A was detected in 2/16 responders and 2/20 non-responders, L702H was detected in 1/16 responders and 2/20 non-responders. No differences were seen with regard to TP53 mutations, 6/20 non-responders and 7/16 responders. Non-AR/non-TP53 mutations were not distinct in the two groups but trended (P = 0.15) toward being more common in non-responders (5/16 in responders versus 11/20 non-responders). Pre- and post- ctDNA analyses were conducted in 5/6 patients for those with AR amplification at baseline. In all 5 of these patients, the degree of AR amplification diminished after testosterone injections. Conclusions: In this analysis of CRPC patients who were responders and non-responders to 400 mg testosterone cypionate q 3-4 weeks (post-abiraterone and/or enzalutamide), only AR amplifications in ctDNA were predictive of response. In all measured patients, the degree of AR amplification in the ctDNA diminished after testosterone injections.',\n",

       "  '174Background: Despite the advent of chemotherapy and androgen-receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi), patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) still show poor prognosis and reduced survival. The selective pressure induced by treatments favors the activation of alternative metabolic pathways that allow the persistence of cancer cells in unfavorable conditions. This study aimed at assessing the lipidomic profiles of patients with mCRPC, in order to identify lipid species potentially useful to predict for prognosis and response to therapies. Methods: Plasma samples were collected from patients with mCRPC who were starting a first-line treatment for mCRPC (1L) (n = 30) and from those who had already received at least two lines of treatment for mCRPC ( > 2L) (n = 19), including at least one ARSi and a taxane. Lipids were extracted from plasma samples using a modified Matyash method employing a mix of cold MeOH and MTBE and containing a mix of deuterated standards (Splash Lipidomix). Lipids were then analyzed with an untargeted lipidomic approach using an UHPLC Vanquish system coupled with a Q-Exactive Plus instrument. T-test was then applied to identify lipid species and classes that were differentially expressed in 1L vs < 2L patients. Results: We identified and quantified a total of 907 plasma lipids. Overall, 68 lipid species were significantly dysregulated in > 2L compared to 1L plasma samples. 56 species were found to be upregulated, whereas 12 were downregulated, with a fold change (FC) > 1.3 or < 0.75 and a p-value < 0.05. At the level of lipid classes, > 2L patients showed higher levels of acylcarnitine (CAR), diacylglycerols (DG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and triacylglycerols (TG). The following lipids showed the highest FC: DG28:2 = 4.2; CAR14:0 = 3.7; CAR20:1 = 2.6; CAR18:0 = 2.3; PE40:6 = 2.3. Conversely, significantly lower levels of specific phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sterols (ST) were found in > 2L compared to 1L patients. The following species showed the lowest FC: PCO-39:3 = 0.52; ST29:1;O;S = 0.55; PC36:5 = 0.55; PC36.4 = 0.60. These results suggest that patients with strongly pretreated mCRPC show higher levels of lipid species involved in the switch between the glucose and fatty acid metabolism. We also found a dysregulation of ceramides and sphingomyelins which are well-known lipid species involved in apoptosis and cancer progression. Specific lipids warrant further investigation to be used as potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers in patients with mCRPC. Conclusions: Using a quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we investigated the dysregulation of lipids and lipid metabolism in mCRPC patients at different disease stages. We found that specific lipid species show differential levels in patients pretreated with ARSi and chemotherapy, compared to those who are naïve to these treatments, paving the way for further investigations in this field.',\n",

This final update of a retrospective, multicenter analysis explores the association between genomic mutations in the PI3K-AKT and DDR signalling pathways with ARAT treatment outcomes in nmCRPC patients. Methods: Relevant clinical endpoint were collected for high-risk nmCRPC patients treated with an ARAT at APCaRI affiliated cancer centers, including median metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), PSA decline ≥ 50% (PSA50), and second progression free survival (PFS2). Archival tumor tissue was accessed for next generation gene sequencing, examining for genomic alterations in 500 genes, including those involved in the DDR and the PI3K-AKT signalling pathways. Comparison of outcomes of patients with DDR and PI3K-AKT pathway mutations was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression using wildtype cases as the reference group, adjusting for PSA doubling time and pelvic lymphadenopathy. Results: Of the 37 patients included, 30 (82%) received apalutamide, 5 (13%) received darolutamide, and 2 (6%) received enzalutamide. 10 patients (27%) had PI3K-AKT pathway mutations (4 PTEN, 3 PIK3Ca, 2 PIK3C2G, 1 PIK3C2b), 8 patients (22%) had DDR gene mutations (3 ATM, 2 CHEK1, 1 BRCA2, 1 CDK12, 1 CHEK2, 1 FANCD2, 1 FANCL), and 1 patient (3%) had 2 MLH1 mutations (microsatellite instability). Of those who had subsequent treatment, 1 received enzalutamide and 5 received abiraterone. Patients with PI3K-AKT pathway mutations had significantly shorter MFS (4.8 mo; HR 4.2; 95% CI 1.2 – 15.0; p = 0.025). Those with DDR mutations had a trend towards shorter MFS (23.3 mo HR 3.7; 95% CI 0.71 – 13.4; p = 0.134). OS data remains immature. 4 (11%) patients did not achieve PSA50, including a patient with 2 MLH1 mutations. Conclusions: This final analysis demonstrates that nmCRPC with PI3K and DDR signalling pathway mutations have poor clinical outcomes when treated with ARAT, likely secondary to decreased reliance on the androgen receptor signalling pathway. These results highlight the potential value of exploring targeted therapies, such as PARP or AKT inhibitors in patients with these mutations.',\n",

       "  '176Background: Despite androgen deprivation therapy, prostate cancer will develop resistance known as castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Androgen signaling is associated with pathways that influence cell proliferation and survival via cell cycle regulation. AR signaling results in inactivation of Rb tumor suppressor by way of AKT and reduction in intrinsic CDK4/6 inhibitors. Since PTEN loss is found in 40% of mCRPC and AKT pathway is a mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance, we hypothesize adding an AKT inhibitor to a CDK4/6 inhibitor will have synergistic activity while delaying CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance. Preclinical xenografts have been shown to recapitulate patient response, therefore, can be used to guide clinical trials using novel combinations. Methods: We have established patient derived tumor xenograft models (GUR-017M, TMA-027 and PRJ-88T) from patients with mCRPC with each having a unique genomic alteration profile. In the clinical setting, GUR-017M was resistant to abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel and had exposure to docetaxel. TMA-027 and PRJ-88T were resistant to enzalutamide. We combined a CDK4/6 inhibitor with an AKT inhibitor and treated each of these patient tumors in NOD-SCID mice for a total duration of 40 days. Mice were implanted and separated into 4 groups (placebo, CDK4/6 inhibitor, AKT inhibitor and CDK4/6 + AKT inhibitor) with 10-13 mice in each group. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week. For GUR-017M, abemaciclib (50 mg/kg) was combined with MK2206 (120 mg/kg) and was compared to each placebo and each single agent alone. For TMA-027, palbociclib (50 mg/kg) was combined with ipatasertib (50 mg/kg). After 40 days, tumors were harvested for immunohistochemistry analysis. PRJ-88T was grown as 3D spheroids in ultra-low attachment plates and treated with palbociclib + ipatasertib (10 uM-100uM) to evaluate for synergy. Results: GUR-017M and TMA-027 showed significant delayed tumor growth compared to placebo or either single agent alone. In the GUR-017M group, the final mean tumor volume for the combination group was 149 mm3, compared to 377 mm3 (abemaciclib), 358 mm3 (MK2206) and 527 mm3 placebo group, representing a percent decrease compared to control by 72%, 29%, and 32%, respectively. For TMA-027, the final mean tumor volume for the combination group was 102 mm3, compared to 259 mm3 (palbociclib), 416 mm3 (ipatasertib), and 402 mm3 placebo group, representing a percent decrease compared to control by 75%, 36%, and 4%, respectively. PRJ-88T 3D spheroids showed synergy with palbociclib + ipatasertib. In vivo experiments using PRJ-88T are in progress. Conclusions: The preclinical results show combining CDK4/6 inhibitors with AKT inhibitors is a promising treatment strategy and provides the basis for a clinical trial in patients with mCRPC.',\n",

       "  '177Background: Germline alterations are found in approximately 12-17% of CRPC patients. Similarly, evaluating tumoral changes with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has become an increasingly useful tool for understanding mechanisms underpinning disease progression. In this study, we evaluated both germline and somatic genetic changes in patients with mCRPC. Methods: Patients included had germline screening and ctDNA analyzed with the Guardant 360 assay. All patients were CRPC at the time of Guardant testing. Germline alterations were classified as pathogenic/likely-pathogenic or not pathogenic. Only ctDNA alterations with an alleleic fraction greater than 0.5% were included in analyses. Additional evaluation of CRPC status, treatment history, family history and other clinical covariates are ongoing. Chi-square and Fischer’s Exact tests were used for comparison of cohorts. Results: A total of 168 Caucasian CRPC patients had Guardant 360 testing at time of progression and germline testing between 2015-2021. 61% (n = 102/168) of patients have previously had treatment with abiraterone, 49% (n = 82/168) have had Enzalutamide and 40% (n = 68/168) have had treatment with taxanes. 12% (n = 20/168) of CRPC patients had a pathogenic/likely-pathogenic (P/LPv) germline alteration, 46% (n = 77/168) had a germline variant of unknown significance (VUS), 42% (n = 71/168) were germline negative. CRPC patients with pathogenic germline mutations were significantly more likely to have subsequent somatic alterations in BRCA2 (OR = 5.05, 95% C.I. (1.11, 23.01), p = 0.055), NF1 (OR = 7.89, 95% C.I. (2.15, 28.10), p = 0.004), and TP53 (OR = 3.52, 95% C.I. (1.28, 9.68), p = 0.015). In TP53, among germline positive patients, 45% (n = 9/20) had TP53 alterations compared to 30% (n = 45/148) of germline negative patients. Conclusions: Germline positive (P/LPv) CRPC patients were significantly more likely to have somatic alterations in BRCA2, NF1, and TP53. Understanding the totality of genetic changes, both germline and acquired somatic alterations is essential as the arsenal of targeted treatment for CRPC continues to expand. Additional studies including longitudinal assessment genetic changes and clinical correlates will be necessary to evaluate these findings in the context of treatment outcomes and disease progression.',\n",

       "  '178Background: Prostate cancer comprises one third of male Veteran cancers and is their second leading cause of cancer death. Metastatic prostate cancer is lethal. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of somatic tumors is recommended for metastatic prostate to identify actionable alterations targeted with approved therapies. Veterans with prostate cancers harboring alterations in genes involved in the DNA damage response (e.g. BRCA1/2) or high microsatellite instability (MSI-High) may be eligible for PARP inhibitors or checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, respectively. Potential candidates may be identified for ongoing clinical trials of novel precision oncology approaches. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of clinical, genomic, demographic data from Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer who underwent somatic NGS using the Foundation Medicine NGS platform from 2019-February 2021. To be included, prostate cancer was submitted diagnosis for the NGS testing and metastatic disease determined by the VINCI natural language processing tool. Variables included demographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics (self-identified race/ethnicity, age, rurality of residence, Gleason score, specimen site, other cancer diagnosis, mutation frequency). Primary outcome was mutation rates in homologous recombination (HR) genes under current FDA approval for olaparib (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54L) or MSI-High. Raw variant data, submitted diagnosis, and clinical data were extracted from the NGS reports and harmonized for further variant annotation. Variant data included chromosome, position, reference and alternate allele, total depth, variant allele depth, and quality scores. Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR. Likely oncogenic and oncogenic mutations were identified using OncoKB. Results: 1,597 Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer underwent FMI NGS testing (63% White, 33% African American, 4% other). Median age was 66 years, 78.6% of cases from >60 years. Of the 1,597 who underwent blood or tumor testing, at least one likely oncogenic mutation in an HR gene under FDA approval for olaparib was found in 369 (23.1%) of Veterans (19% of tissue-based tests, 32.9% of blood-based tests). Of 651 liquid biopsy tests with at least one HR gene mutation, 125 of 214 (52%) had mutations at a variant allele frequency (VAF) <0.5% or were found in an MSI-High sample that could indicate a spurious mutation due to clonal hematopoiesis. 33 patients (2.1%) were MSI-High, (21 tissue-based and 12 blood-based). Frequencies of alterations in ATM (3.6%), CDK12 (5.6%), and BRCA2 (4%) in tissue-based tests were not significantly different from those reported in other series. Conclusions: NGS of somatic tumors from Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer identifies alterations that impact management and clinical outcomes.',\n",

       "  '179Background: Tumor-only and/or liquid-biopsy based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based tests, which are routinely performed in metastatic prostate cancer patients, may identify putative germline mutations. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) made recommendations on findings which should be referred for germline genetic testing; however, it is unknown the burden of genetic testing referrals that may result from implementation of these recommendations. We therefore determined the frequency of putative germline findings in Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer who have undergone NGS-based sequencing of tumor and/or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) on the Foundation Medicine (FMI) platform. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of Veterans with FMI NGS testing results reported from January 2019-February 2021 who had prostate cancer as the submitted diagnosis and metastatic diagnosis according to a VINCI natural language processing tool. Raw variant data were extracted from FMI reports and harmonized for variant annotation. Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR. Putative germline mutations were defined as 1) likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) by Clinvar annotation and VAF> 30%. Mutation rates are reported in genes recommended by ESMO to trigger referral for germline testing in all tumor types and all ages of diagnosis and proposed prostate cancer susceptibility genes (ATM, BARD1, CHEK2). Results: 1,597 Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer underwent FMI NGS testing (63% White, 33% African American, 4% other). Median age was 66 years, with 78.6% of cases from men >60 years. Of 1,597 prostate cancer patients who underwent blood or tumor testing, n=85 (5.3%) had an LP/P mutation in an ESMO-guideline gene. When mutations in ATM, BARD1 and CHEK2 were added, n=133 (8.3%) of patients had an LP/P mutation. The most commonly identified putative germline findings were in BRCA2 (n=49 patients, 3.1%). 18 patients (1.1%) had mutations in other prostate cancer risk genes on the ESMO list (BRCA1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). 18 (1.1%) of patients had putative incidental germline findings, which included mutations in PALB2, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, SDHC. No putative incidental germline mutations were identified in RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHD, TSC2, VHL.  Comparing self-identified White versus self-identified Black patients, putative germline mutation rates were nearly the same in all ESMO-referral genes combined (8.2% vs 8.5%), BRCA2 (2.9% vs 3.0%), and ATM (2.4% vs 2.1%). Conclusions: While guidelines recommend that all veterans with metastatic prostate cancer undergo germline genetic testing, significant patient and system-level barriers continue to limit access to germline genetic testing for many Veterans. Tumor-only NGS testing, with a low rate of putative incidental findings, can help to prioritize which Veterans should be referred for germline genetic testing.',\n",

       "  '180Background: ctDNA testing is a non-invasive means to identify genomic alterations in patients with aPC, including BRCA1/2 and other HRR gene alterations, which are targetable by PARP inhibitors (PARPi). However, classes of HRR inactivating mutations, such as copy number loss and large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) are challenging to detect by ctDNA. Here we describe a CLIA-validated plasma-based ctDNA test that identifies copy number loss and LGRs, in addition to SNV and Indels, in HRR genes. We report the landscape of HRR deficiency (HRD) in a clinical population of > 2,000 patients with aPC. Methods: 2932 samples from patients with aPC previously tested as part of clinical care using an 83-gene cfDNA NGS assay (Guardant360) within an 11-month period were reanalyzed for presence of HRD. HRD alterations were defined as copy number loss, LGR (i.e. intergenic or intragenic gene rearrangements) and deleterious SNV/Indel in 7 clinically focused HRR genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51D). Clinical information, when available, was obtained from test requisition forms. Results: The median age of the analyzed cohort was 73 years (range: 31-100); when known, the majority of patients were tested at disease progression (81%, 2242/2750). In total, an inactivating BRCA1/2 variant was was identified in 26% (605/2932) of reanalyzed patients, comprising BRCA1/2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (13.4% of patients), deleterious SNV or Indels (5.5%), homozygous deletions (3.3%) and LGRs (1.1%). The prevalence of patients with any inactivating HRR alteration increased to 38.5% with the expanded 7 gene set. Overall, prevalence of loss-of-function mutations (SNV/Indel, homozygous deletion or LGR) in BRCA2 was 4.5X frequent than in BRCA1 and comparable to previously described prostate cohorts (8.4% and 1.8% compared to 8.6% and 1.1% in tissue, respectively). Conclusions: Genomic profiling by ctDNA identified an HRR alteration landscape comparable to previously characterized tissue cohorts, with enrichment in BRCA2 over BRCA1 inactivating mutations and frequent BRCA1/2 LOH. Patients with aPC may benefit from PARPi eligibility determination using rapid and reliable ctDNA assessment, particularly at progression. Future studies should assess PARPi outcomes for this population.',\n",

       "  '181Background: The proto-oncogene c-Myc is a transcription factor that is upregulated in several human cancers. Despite its key role, therapeutic targeting of c-Myc remains a challenge because of a disordered protein tertiary structure. The basic helical structure and zipper protein of c-Myc forms an obligate heterodimer with its partner MAX to function as a transcription factor. An attractive strategy is to inhibit MYC/MAX dimerization to decrease c-Myc transcriptional function. Several methods have been described to inhibit MYC/MAX dimerization including small molecular inhibitors and proteomimetics. Methods: We used NOD SCID gamma mice (NGS mice) that are immunodeficient, non-obese diabetic laboratory mice (Jackson Laboratories, Cat #J000077451) carrying patient-derived xenograft (PDX) following implantation of grade IV adenocarcinoma of the prostate from a patient into the flanks of each mouse. For maximum tolerable dose studies, we used C57BL/6 wild type mice (Jackson Laboratories, Cat #J000664). We performed a maximum dose tolerability study with the drug 3JC48-3 up to 100 mg/kg to determine limiting toxicity. We monitored the rate of growth for 2 weeks and measured the final volume of the tumors. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed using the prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, that were treated with the drug 3JC48-3 at different doses (0, 5, 10, and 20uM) for 24 hours and subsequently lysed. Results: We found 3JC48-3 decreases prostate cancer growth and viability in a dose-dependent fashion in\\xa0vitro. We confirmed the inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization by 3JC48-3 using immunoprecipitation experiments. Normal mice and mice with patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts (PDX) tolerated intraperitoneal injections of 3JC48-3 up to 100 mg/kg body weight without dose-limiting toxicity. Preliminary results in these PDX mouse models suggest that 3JC48-3 may be effective in decreasing the rate of tumor growth. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that 3JC48-3 is a potent MYC/MAX heterodimerization inhibitor that decreases prostate cancer growth and viability in association with upregulation of both PrKD1 expression and kinase activity. In addition, 3JC48-3 is well tolerated in prostate cancer PDX mice models and may be a candidate drug for further preclinical development.',\n",

       "  '182Background: There is an unmet need to develop a noninvasive assay to detect the metastatic progression of prostate cancer (PCa) patients for timely treatment. We aim to optimize an extracellular vesicle (EV)-based Digital Scoring Assay to reflect the disease status of PCa. Methods: PCa EV Digital Scoring Assay integrated a PCa-derived EV purification device (i.e., EV Click Chip) and downstream reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR for transcriptomic profiling of PCa-derived EVs. The performance of the Assay for purifying PCa-derived EVs was assessed using artificial plasma samples with spiked EVs. In parallel, a panel of 11 PCa-relevant mRNA markers were selected and validated. PCa EV Digital Scoring Assay in conjugation with the 11-gene panel was tested using plasma from 20 localized, 20 metastatic PCa patients, and serial plasma from three PCa patients. mRNA expressions were computed using weighted Z score method. ROC analysis was utilized to distinguish localized from metastatic PCa. Results: After optimization, the capability of purifying PCa-derived EVs from artificial plasma samples by EV Click Chips (92.5 ± 5.4%) outperformed ultracentrifugation or precipitation methods (41.0 ± 3.2%; 34.9± 2.2%; P < 0.001). Eleven genes, i.e., ACP3, FOLH1, HOXB13, KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, MSMB, RLN1, SLC45A3, STEAP2, and TMPRSS, were selected using The Tissue Atlas and a gene set from a blood-based study as our panel. Strong signals of the panel were detected from three PCa cells (LNCaP, C4-2B, and 22Rv1) and their derived EVs, while rare signals were detected in either WBCs or EVs purified from male healthy donor. In the clinical study, the Z scores calculated from the selected 11-gene panel, were significantly higher in 20 metastatic PCa than 20 localized PCa with an area under the ROC curve of 0.88 (95% CI = 0.78-0.98). Lastly, longitudinal analyses of three PCa patients showed that the Z scores can reflect the clinical progression, response, and stable status, even when disease is undetectable by imaging. Conclusions: We develop a sensitive PCa EV Digital Scoring Assay to distinguish metastatic PCa and reveal the dynamic disease states in a noninvasive manner. This assay holds the potential to augment current imaging tools and tests for timely detection of PCa progression and improve care for patients.',\n",

Methods: This retrospective study used the Optum health insurance claims database, which includes pt claims data from commercially insured and Medicare Advantage populations. Adult pts (≥18 years) had ≥2 claims for prostate cancer (PC) and ≥1 claim for metastasis (the first claim was index date) within 90 days (d) prior to, or any time after, the first claim for PC from January 2014– June 2019. 1L treatments included any systemic treatment for mCSPC within 90 d pre-index, plus any other treatment received within 180 d of the first. Physician specialty was determined from medical or pharmacy claims during 1L treatment and categorized as Urologist; Oncologist; urologists and oncologists (Both); or other specialties (Other). Treatment patterns and pt characteristics across specialties were analyzed descriptively. Results: Of 4,675 mCSPC pts identified, 16% received care from Urologists, 20% from Oncologists, 63% from Both, and 1% from Other. Pts seen by Urologists were more likely to be older and have Medicare compared to pts seen by the Oncologists or Both. Treatment intensification with NHT and/or DOC was numerically higher among Oncologists and Both compared with Urologists. However, all specialties prescribed ADT ± first-generation NSAA most frequently for 1L mCSPC treatment, even in patients with visceral metastases (Table). Conclusions: Despite evidence of improved survival with intensified treatment for pts with mCSPC, we observed its underuse by all specialties and even among pts with visceral metastases. Our results highlight a great need to advance the implementation of evidence-based medicine in mCSPC. 1. Sayegh N et\\xa0al. JCO Oncol Pract 2021; OP2100206. 2. Ryan CJ et\\xa0al.

Participants complete a baseline survey of demographic information and cancer genetics knowledge. Post-conference survey includes retaking knowledge questions and feedback on cases and Zoom format. Results: At the time of this report, 57 participants have engaged in the virtual genetics board. Participants include genetic counselors (21%), nurse practitioners (21%), medical oncologists (14%), researchers/scientists (14%), nurses (9%), urologists (5%), radiation oncologists (4%), and other specialties. Practice settings include academic centers (49%), public hospitals (16%), private hospitals (11%), and other settings. The baseline survey was completed by 55 participants, and post-conference survey by 34 participants. Knowledge scores increased regarding cancer inheritance, rates of mutations in metastatic PCA, BRCA2-related cancers, risk of PCA for HOXB13 carriers, and risk for PCA in African American males. Feedback was positive, with over 90% favorable responses on usability of technology, usefulness of case discussions, and relevance to informational needs. Conclusions: Initial results support a virtual genetics board to increase PCA genetic evaluation knowledge. The ENGAGEMENT study is ongoing with monthly live case discussions that are also recorded for on-demand viewing; registration is available at www.prostategenetics.com/engagement.Topics covered in first three months of virtual genetics board.Topics Covered*July 2021August 2021September 2021CaseMetastatic PCAEarly stage PCAPCA screeningGermline testing criteriaxxxPretest counseling elementsxxxFamily history collectionxxxGermline testing options and considerationsxxxBRCA2-related PCA management and hereditary cancer managementxxxRelevant trialsxxxIncidental findingsxGermline classification criteriaxSomatic testing considerationsxImportance of cascade testingxxx *Upcoming conferences will cover management of patients with mutations in a spectrum of genes, along with breadth of clinical scenarios, and hereditary cancer considerations.

       "  '185Background: Short-term effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination is widely demonstrated, but the emerging real-world data suggest that immunity may wane over-time (Levin et\\xa0al. NEJM 2021). Herein we aimed to explore the long-term efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccination among pts with genitourinary cancer. Methods: In this study, pts with genitourinary malignancies (prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers) who had not received COVID-19 vaccination were included. Blood samples were collected prior to and after one dose of either an adenovirus- or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine at the 2- and 6-month timepoints. Additional blood samples from pts receiving systemic treatment were collected at 3 consecutive therapy cycles following vaccination. Antibody titers were assessed using the SCoV-2 Detect IgG ELISA assay and results were reported as immune status ratios (ISR). T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing was performed using the MiXCR software (MiLabs) and custom strips were used to assess TCR abundance and homology clustering. Results: A total of 183 pts were enrolled, and 136 pts provided baseline blood samples. Among these, 59 (8:51 F:M) provided samples for both the 2- and 6-month timepoints by the 10/6/2021 data cut-off. In this subset of pts, median age was 66 (range 48-85) and 33 (55.9%), 25 (42.4%), and 1 (1.7%) pts had prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer, respectively. A majority of the pts (93.2%) were on systemic treatment with 23.7% on immune checkpoint inhibitors, 18.6% on targeted agents, and 1.7% on chemotherapy. The most commonly administered vaccines were BNT162b2 (61.0%) followed by mRNA-1273 (37.3%) and Ad26.COV2.S (1.7%). The mean (±standard deviation) ISR values at baseline and 2 months were 0.68±1.59 and 6.62±1.75, respectively. At the 6-month timepoint, mean ISR was 5.46±1.61; this was significantly lower than the 2-month antibody titers (p < 0.0001), and reflects a reduction of 17.6%. Further data on TCR sequencing will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first data assessing the long-term serologic outcomes of COVID-19 vaccination in pts with cancer. Our data suggest waning immunity over time in cancer pts. Strategies to prolong host immunity against SARS COV-2 (e.g., booster vaccination) are likely warranted.',\n",

However, the molecular underpinnings behind the poor prognosis is not entirely understood. In this study, we aimed to assess the tumoral genomic characteristics in pts with dn-hv-mCSPC. Methods: In this IRB-approved study, patient-level data were collected retrospectively. Eligibility: patients with mCSPC with availability of tumor comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) from a CLIA-certified lab before start of ADT. Clinically relevant genes previously reported to be associated with prognosis in metastatic prostate cancer were included: TP53, PTEN, RB1, BRCA2, CDK12, MYC, PIK3CA, SPOP, APC, CTNNB1, and, ATM. Variants of unknown significance and genomic aberrations present in < 5% pts were excluded. High-volume disease was defined per CHAARTED criteria. Genomic aberration prevalence was compared using a Chi-square test and was adjusted for false discovery (Benjamini-Hochberg). Results: 304 pts were eligible: dn-hv-mCSPC (N = 100) vs non-dn-hv-mCSPC (N = 204); median age 67 vs 63 years, median PSA at baseline 35 vs 14 ng/mL, median Gleason score 9 vs 9, visceral metastases 15% vs 3%. 41% and 27% of pts had ≥2 mutations in the dn-hv-mcSPC and non-dn-hv-mCSPC respectively (P = 0.01). Overall, most commonly mutated genes were TP53, TMPRSS2, and PTEN. Pts with dn-hv-mCSPC had higher frequency of TP53 (P = 0.016) and BRCA2 (P = 0.03) mutations. Conclusions: In this real-world patient population, dn-hv-mCSPC pts were shown to have a greater number of clinically relevant genomic aberrations. Detailed genomic landscape of these pts will be presented in the meeting. These hypotheses-generating data need external validation.',\n",

       "  '187  Background: Prostate cancer was the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020 and the fifth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Global variations in the burden of prostate cancer have been observed in the past decades. This study aimed to assess the trends in incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years from prostate cancer in the World Health Organization (WHO) regions and extensively in the European Union (EU) 15+ countries from 1990 to 2019. Methods: The Global Burden of Disease Study database was used to extract the mortality data of prostate cancer, based on the International Classification of Diseases versions 10 and 9. Data acquired for different WHO regions and each country of the EU15+ nations, per year from 1990 to 2019, included age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), age-standardized death rates (ASDR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIR) were then computed. Trends were assessed using Joinpoint regression. Results: Between 1990 and 2019, ASIRs increased worldwide (+13.16%), except in the American region, with the largest growth in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) (+72.43%). While ASDRs and DALYs increased in Africa, South-East Asia, and EMR, they decreased in the Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific Region (WPR). MIRs decreased universally (-25.52%), mainly in the WPR (-43.49%). In EU15+ countries, ASIRs increased in all countries, except for Canada (-11.27%) and the United States of America (USA) (-10.37%), with the largest rise in Finland (+75.11%). ASDRs decreased in all countries, with the widest drop in Luxembourg (-41.89%) and the lowest in Denmark (-13.96%). MIRs decreased in all countries, with the highest drop in Finland (-55.37%). Similarly, DALYs decreased in all countries, with the highest decrease in Luxembourg (-40.56%). In 2019, the highest ASIR was in the USA (118.24/100,000), whereas Denmark had the highest ASDR (31.35/100,000), MIR (0.38/100,000), and DALY (498.03/100,000). Conclusions: Over the 30 years, the incidence of prostate cancer has been rising worldwide, excluding Canada and the USA. However, the universal decrease of MIRs highlights improved outcomes and efficient screening and therapeutic strategies.

       "  '188Background: Germline testing for prostate cancer (PCA) is now central to treatment, screening, and hereditary cancer management. The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is a key DNA repair pathway involved in PCA biology and treatment. Prevalence of FA genes BRCA2, PALB2, and BRIP1 is well-described; however, multiple other FA genes are not routinely tested, with limited prevalence data. Here we report mutation prevalence of a spectrum of FA genes among men undergoing PCA multigene testing on the Evaluation and Management for Prostate Oncology, Wellness, and Risk (EMPOWeR) study. Methods: Eligibility includes any male with PCA or at-risk for PCA. Multigene testing includes 51 genes; FA pathway genes include BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, FANCL, and FANCM. Multiple additional cancer risk genes were tested. Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to compare the prevalence of FA gene mutations between participants in the EMPOWeR study vs population prevalence reported in the literature. Statistical significance level of all tests was set a priori to 0.05. Results: The current cohort includes 235 participants. Characteristics are White (83.3%), Black (13.7%), PCA diagnosis (83.4%), mean age of PCA diagnosis 61.7 + 7.69 years, Gleason score >=7 (66.2%), and T3 or higher (29.4%). Genetic results were available for 179 participants. Overall, 11.1% of participants (n=20) had a pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutation identified. Among mutation carriers, 45% (n=9) had mutations in FA genes, including FANCA (n=3), BRCA2 (n=2), FANCM (n=1), FANCD2 (n=1), PALB2 (n=1), and BRIP1 (n=1). Table shows clinical characteristics of participants with mutations in FANCA, FANCM, and FANCD2. Further mutation spectrum included: CHEK2 (n=3), NBN (n=2), MUTYH (n=2), BRCA (n=1), ATM (n=1), HOXB13 (n=1), APC (n=1). Compared to population prevalence, FA mutation prevalence was significantly higher overall (5.0% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.010) and among mutation carriers (45% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001). Conclusions: While prevalence of FA genes BRCA2, PALB2, and BRIP1 is well-described, our study supports testing a broader range of FA genes given the prevalence rates, potential implications for clinical trials, targeted therapy, inherited syndromes, and reproductive implications.Clinical characteristics of participants with FA gene mutations.ParticipantGeneAlterationInterpretationAge DxPSA DxGleasonStageTx1FANCAc.3066+1G>A (Splice donor)Likely pathogenic563.99 (4+5)pT3bN0MXSurgery + RT + ADT2FANCAc.3788_3790del (p.Phe1263del)pathogenic5515.19 (4+5)pT3bN0MXSurgery + RT + ADT3FANCMc.5791C>T (p.Arg1931*)pathogenic638.37 (3+4)pT3aN0MxSurgery + RT4FANCAc.4198C>T (p.Arg1400Cys)pathogenic53N/A9 (4+5)pT3bN0MXSurgery + RT + ADT5FANCD2c.2715+1G>A (Splice donor)pathogenic735.46 (3+3)Active surveillance ',\n",

Current imaging modalities perform poorly in this regard. PSMA imaging is FDA approved but reimbursement remains a considerable issue for most patients. Methods: This is a phase II expanded access intermediate sized clinical trial using 68Ga-PSMA-11 (Telix Pharma cold kit) under our own Investigational New Drug (IND) with the FDA. Two cohorts are utilized, recurrent disease with a PSA > 0.2 or > 2.0 post-radiation, and newly diagnosed high risk localized disease and/or oligo-metastatic patients as assessed by conventional imaging. 300 patients will be allowed to enroll and 63 are enrolled to date. Patients will be injected with 1.8–2.2 MBq/kg body weight with 68Ga-PSMA-11 (per EANM guidelines). The lower and upper limits of the dose are set to 3 to 7 mCi respectively. Primary Objective(s): Utilize 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images to define uptake location for localization of prostate cancer metastatic sites in patients prior to initial therapy and to utilize 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET images to define uptake location for localization of prostate cancer including both local recurrences and metastatic sites in patients with recurrent disease after initial therapy. Secondary Objectives: To assess the therapeutic consequences of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging in prostate cancer patients with and without prior treatment. As such the planned therapies after the PSMA scan will be annotated and recorded. In addition, we aim to determine the number of patients with metastatic disease prior to initial therapy that was not diagnosed with conventional imaging and we aim to determine the locations of recurrent disease for those patients who have demonstrated PSA recurrence after curative therapy. Percentage of positive scans will be assessed for PSA values 0.2-0.5 ng/mL, > 0.5-1.0 ng/mL, > 1.0- > 2.0 ng/mL, and > 2 ng/mL. Results will be summarized descriptively with 95% confidence intervals. Localization of all lesions will be performed with regard to lymph nodes (pelvic versus non-pelvis), bones (by location), and other (by site). Treatment planning will be captured and quantified by radiation, surgery, hormonal therapy (type and duration), and/or observation at the time of the initial clinical visit after the PSMA scan and 6 months later.

       "  'TPS190Background: Men with advanced prostate cancer (APC) experience high mortality and severely impacted quality of life due to the disease itself as well as its therapies, with Black men facing the highest disease burden. The treatment landscape for APC is rapidly changing; however, little is known about the real-life experience of men receiving new therapies. There is an urgent need to identify disparities in treatment patterns and outcomes in advanced disease, based on patient and country demographics. The International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer (IRONMAN) is uniquely equipped to meet these needs. Methods: IRONMAN is a population-based prospective cohort of men with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) and castration-resistant (CRPC) prostate cancer aiming to enroll 5,000 men across 16 countries (Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Untied States). Patients are followed prospectively for overall survival, clinically significant adverse events, changes in cancer treatments, biomarkers, and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Data is collected via longitudinal electronic questionnaires from patients and providers as well as blood samples and medical records. IRONMAN is currently enrolling in 10 countries at 103 sites. Sites were selected to create a diverse cohort across race/ethnicity, rural/urban populations, socioeconomic factors, and geographic regions. Of the first 1,865 men enrolled to date, 60% have mHSPC and 40% have CRPC; overall, 9% of men (18% in the US) self-identify as Black and 82% identify as white (78% in the US). 60% (N = 1,111) of this cohort has been enrolled outside of the US, and the median age at study entry is 70 years. The distribution and demographics of patients are continuously monitored to inform ongoing enrollment efforts. The IRONMAN Diversity Working Group meets monthly to discuss barriers and strategies to enhance enrollment of a racially and ethnically diverse population. The Low- and Middle-Income Country Working Group addresses the unique needs of men being recruited from the Caribbean and African sites in addition to supporting broad oncology efforts in these regions. These efforts support IRONMAN’s larger goal to investigate disparities in the care of patients with APC, having potential implications for decreasing racial disparities in survival outcomes.

       "  'TPS191Background: Recent updates to genetic testing recommendations and approved treatment options for prostate cancer (PCa) patients (pts) have clarified the need for comprehensive genetic registries. Germline DNA damage repair (DDR) defects are present in over 10% of pts who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) while 5-10% of pts with localized PCa have germline pathogenic variants in DDR genes. NCCN guidelines have recently expanded to address genetic testing to include high risk localized, node positive and metastatic disease, in addition to family cancer history criteria. In May 2020, the FDA approved 2 PARP inhibitors for mCRPC treatment. Genetic registries can address the critical need to identify pts for recently approved targeted treatments, understand real-world effects of targeted therapies, and expand clinical trials examining less common mutations. PROMISE is a prospective genetic registry equipped to meet these needs. Methods: 5,000 PCa pts will be screened via the online study portal and at-home germline testing to identify and enroll 500 eligible pts with germline pathogenic variants, likely pathogenic variants, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the genes of interest: ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, GEN1, HOXB13, MRE11A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, TP53 and XRCC2. Additional genes may be added as evidence emerges. Eligible pts must be assigned male at birth and have documented PCa through tissue biopsy, and/or PSA >100ng/dL, and/or radiographic evidence of disease. Pts with or without prior genetic testing, including those with known pathogenic variants, are encouraged to enroll. Exclusion criteria are: inability or unwillingness to provide information for eligibility and incomplete inclusion criteria. Following germline testing, all pts will be offered genetic counseling and periodic newsletters with updates on treatments and clinical trials. Every 6 months, eligible pts will complete a patient-reported outcome (PRO) survey (EORTC QLQ-C30) and updated medical records will be obtained for clinical data abstraction. Eligible pts will enter long-term follow-up. The primary endpoint is the creation of a prospective genetic registry of PCa pts. Additional endpoints include: frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants of interest, recruitment of a control group with a VUS in the genes of interest, association between disease characteristics and germline testing results, comparison of PROs between disease subpopulations, longitudinal outcomes, and overall survival.

       "  'TPS192Background: Radiotherapy of the primary tumor in metastatic prostate cancer is life-prolonging in patients with limited disease spread. Several different fractionation schedules have been used, most widely used is a four-week schedule of 2.75-3 Gy in 19-20 fractions. More data is emerging around hypo-fractionated radiotherapy in the curative setting. We hypothesize that a modified version of the Scandinavian Hypo-trial fractionation 6.1Gy per fraction x 6 fractions over a span of 2½ week will be non-inferior in side-effects as a 4-week schedule but more convenient for patients and caregivers. Methods: The Hypo-M1 trial is a randomized, stratified, multi-center, phase 3 clinical trial recruiting 420 patients in 9 Swedish centers. Key eligibility criteria include histological confirmed prostate cancer, indication for radiotherapy of low burden metastatic prostate cancer, defined as a max of 4 skeletal metastases at any site or lymph node metastases outside the pelvis and no other diseases or treatments interfering with radiotherapy or a score > 20 on the International prostate symptom score (IPSS) scale. Patients will be randomized to either 3 Gy x 19 or 6.1Gy x 6. Stratification factors are T1-T3 vs T4 and randomizing centre. Type of staging procedures performed, CT and whole-body bone scan is recommended, PSMA-PET allowed and further treatment beyond ADT is recorded but not stratification variables. Standard treatment may include docetaxel, apalutamide, abiraterone and enzalutamide at the treating physician’s discretion. Toxicity will be measured before, at the end of radiotherapy and at 1, 3, 6, 12 months and at 3 years. Measures used are the CTCAE v 5.0 and RTOG scales and QoL life will be measured at the same time points with the Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS), a validated QoL instrument focusing on prostate cancer radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is QoL at 3 months and key secondary is acute toxicity at 3 months, late toxicity and QoL at 12 months, failure free survival and cause specific survival. The sample size is calculated for a continuous outcome non-inferiority trial with a one-sided alpha-value of 2.5 % and a beta-value of 80 %. The non-inferiority limit is set to 7.5 % This will require 175 patients with complete follow up in each treatment arm. Expecting a response rate of 80 % for the PCSS at the main time end point the total number of patients in each arm will be 210. The National Prostate Cancer Registry, covering 98% of all prostate cancer cases in Sweden, will be used as CRF including also a randomization module, making this a truly population based clinical trial. As of October 12, 2021, accrual is set to begin in December.

       "  'TPS193Background: Many prostate cancer survivors are treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but these therapies may increase frailty, worsen physical functioning, and increase fall risk. While exercise may counter functional declines associated with ADT, no studies have tested whether and which type of exercise may reduce falls and frailty. The purpose of this trial is to compare the relative efficacy of strength training versus tai ji quan training against each other and to a stretching control group on falls, frailty and physical functioning in men expose to ADT for prostate cancer. Methods: Prostate cancer survivors treated with ADT (n = 360) will be recruited to participate in this single-blind, parallel group, randomized trial. To be eligible men must meet the following criteria: 1) histologically confirmed prostate cancer, 2) received at least 6 months of ADT within the past 10 years, 3) report >1 fall in the past year OR have a score on one of two physical performance tests that is associated with increased fall risk (i.e. ≥ 12.0 seconds to complete the 3 meter timed up and go (TUG), or ≥ 10.0 seconds to complete 5 chair stands), 4) completed any other treatment at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment and not be on any concurrent prostate cancer therapy besides ADT, 5) not currently participating in moderate-vigorous intensity lower-body strength training or tai ji quan training ≥ 2 times/week for ≥ 30 minutes per session, 6) no cognitive difficulties that limit ability to answer survey questions or participate in exercise classes and performance tests, 7) no medical condition, disorder, or take medication that contraindicates participation in moderate intensity exercise, and 8) are able to communicate in English. Participants will be randomized to one of three supervised, group training programs: i) strength training, ii) tai ji quan training, or iii) stretching (control), that train 3x/week for 6 months. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 3 (mid-intervention), 6 (immediately post-intervention) and 12 (follow-up) months. The primary outcome is falls assessed by monthly self-report. Secondary outcomes include the following: Frailty (low lean body mass (by bioelectrical impedance analysis), exhaustion (by SF-36 vitality scale), low activity (by CHAMPS physical activity survey), slowness (by 4m usual walk speed), and weakness (by chair stand time)); Objective and subjective measures of physical function will also be collected. Negative binomial regression models will be used to assess differences in falls between groups, while mixed-effects modeling will be used to compare the relative efficacy of training group on secondary outcomes.

       "  'TPS194Background: Despite a growing number of treatment options for first line mCRPC, approximately 40% of patients (pts) have radiographic progression within the first year. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibition increases genomic instability with double-strand DNA breaks & co-inhibition of AR & PARP induces synthetic lethality in multiple preclinical models. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene aberrations do not appear to be necessary for this synergy as demonstrated in a ph 2 clinical trial of abiraterone & olaparib where this combination improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in HRR-wild-type pts compared with abiraterone alone. A ph 1b trial has since shown that enzalutamide plus rucaparib has acceptable safety profile & no significant drug-drug interactions (S-DDI). Methods: CASPAR/A031902 (NCT04455750) is a ph 3 study in which 984 pts will be randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide plus rucaparib or placebo. HRR gene aberration is not required for enrollment. All pts will undergo next-generation targeted-exome sequencing from archival tumor tissue (new biopsy only required if no archival tissue available). Treatment will be continued until disease progression & crossover is not allowed. Key eligibility criteria are age ≥ 18 years, ECOG PS 0-2, biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma, progressive (PSA or radiographic) disease per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 guidelines, measurable or nonmeasurable disease per RECIST 1.1, no prior treatment for mCRPC (prior docetaxel, abiraterone, darolutamide, or apalutamide in non-mCRPC setting is allowed), no significant uncontrolled comorbidity, & no medications with S-DDI with enzalutamide/rucaparib. Hierarchical co-primary endpoints are rPFS & overall survival (OS). The OS analysis will be undertaken as a primary endpoint if the rPFS endpoint is met. For a one-sided logrank test with a type 1 error rate equal to 0.025, the study has 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.71 in rPFS (median rPFS of 15 & 21 months in control & combination arms, respectively) & 80% power to detect an HR of 0.80 in OS (median OS of 32 & 40 months, respectively). Key secondary endpoints are rPFS & OS in pts with vs without pathogenic BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 alterations; & differences in adverse events & quality of life (QOL) outcomes between the treatment arms. QOL assessments include Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Prostate (FACT-P), Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) & EQ-5D-5L. A key correlative endpoint is the sensitivity of ctDNA-based testing for alterations in HRR genes. Enrollment to CASPAR began in July 2021 & the study is available for participation to all US-NCTN sites with a projected enrollment of 3 years.

       "  'TPS195Background: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is frequently overexpressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and is linked to lineage plasticity and therapy resistance. In pre-clinical studies, EZH2 directly regulates DNA damage repair (DDR) gene expression, and pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to genotoxic stress as induced by poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. The PARP inhibitor talazoparib and EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat are currently under study in mCRPC, and we are conducting a phase 1 clinical trial of the combination. Methods: Phase 1a of the study will define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and phase 1b will better assess safety and preliminary clinical activity of the combination at the RP2D. Eligible patients must have progressive disease after at least one secondary hormonal therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy (or felt not to be more appropriate for taxane), have disease evaluable for response (PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml or measurable disease by RECIST 1.1) and have a metastatic lesion amenable to biopsy adequate for next generation sequencing. In phase 1a (n=9-18), the starting doses are talazoparib 0.75 mg daily and tazemetostat 600 mg BID, with dose escalation/de-escalation of both agents by up to 2 dose levels [DLs] based on a 3+3 design. The RP2D is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or DL +2 (talazoparib 1 mg daily + tazemetostat 800 mg BID) if the MTD is not reached. After 6 patients are treated at the RP2D, phase 1b will enroll an additional 20 patients to an expansion cohort. The primary endpoint of safety and tolerability is based on incidence of dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs] and incidence and grade of adverse events [AEs] by CTCAE version 5.0. For the secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR; defined as PSA reduction by ≥ 50% OR radiographic response by RECIST 1.1), with a sample size of 26 (6 patients from dose escalation and 20 from expansion), we deem talazoparib+tazemetostat effective if ORR is ≥ 5/26 (19%). The probability of concluding that the treatment strategy effective is 0.11 if its true response rate is 10% and at least 0.93 if the true response rate exceeds 30%. Mandatory pre-treatment and on-treatment (8-week) biopsies will undergo targeted genetic sequencing, transcriptomic profiling, ChIP (Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation)-seq, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for DDR and differentiation markers; blood specimens will undergo circulating cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cell profiling – these studies will nominate possible predictive biomarkers for therapeutic response and serve as pharmacodynamic markers of combined PARP and EZH2 inhibition. The goal of this study is to expand treatment options in mCRPC through a novel approach to exploit EZH2 as a therapeutic target through co-targeting the DDR response. Enrollment began in July 2021.

       "  'TPS196Background: Apalutamide is an oral non-steroidal, potent, and highly selective androgen receptor antagonist. Alterations in androgen signaling, DNA repair, and other pathways impact on castration sensitivity and outcomes of androgen antagonists. Currently, there is limited data on the types or effects of variants in prostate cancer (PC)-related genes among Japanese mCSPC (castration-naïve or castration-sensitive) patients treated with apalutamide. Methods: CUARTET is a collaborative phase 4 study with a primary objective of evaluating genomic variants in 73 PC driver genes during apalutamide treatment and hence identify potential biomarkers. Men aged ≥20 years with mCSPC scheduled to start apalutamide at 20 participating institutions will be eligible. Patients previously treated with abiraterone, docetaxel, enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide, are ineligible, as are those who received androgen-deprivation therapy or combined androgen blockade for >6 months before registration or neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal therapy for >36 months. The primary endpoint is the changes in genomic variants of 73 PC driver genes between pre- and post-treatment of apalutamide. Secondary endpoints, stratified by baseline genomic variants, include the proportion of patients with nadir prostate–specific antigen (PSA) ≤0.2 ng/mL, PSA–progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, overall survival, time to castration resistance, and PFS2. Other planned outcomes include safety, incidence/severity of apalutamide-related skin rash stratified by single nucleotide polymorphisms or human leukocyte antigen typing, and clinical outcomes in patients with only distant lymph node metastases. The first patient was enrolled in December 2020, and it is expected to enroll 100 patients during the 1.5-year registration period. Eighty-one patients have been enrolled in this study by July 2021. The patients will be followed up for a maximum of 4.5 years. Interim analyses are planned after the last patient has been registered. Results of CUARTET are expected to reveal the genomic variants, including those in androgen signaling-related genes, that are potentially involved in acquired resistance to apalutamide. The results will reveal biomarkers to aid treatment decision making for mCSPC patients, including the treatment options following apalutamide. Clinical trial information: NCT04601441.',\n",

       "  'TPS197Background: NEPC is an aggressive cancer with no standard treatment approach and poor prognosis. It is usually treatment-emergent, occurring in 15%–20% of patients (pts) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following treatment with androgen signaling inhibitors (ASI) and is characterized by histological transformation from adenocarcinoma to a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor.1 The tumor associated antigen delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) has been identified as a promising target in both NEPC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), as it is highly expressed in these tumors and minimally expressed on normal tissue. Tarlatamab is a DLL3-targeting HLE BiTE® immune therapy designed to bind DLL3 on cancer cells and CD3 on T cells, resulting in T cell activation and expansion and T cell-dependent killing of tumor cells. In preclinical studies, tarlatamab induced T-cell dependent lysis of DLL3-expressing neuroendocrine tumor cell lines, including NEPC cells.2 Interim results of an ongoing first-in-human study in pts with SCLC (NCT03319940) show evidence for tarlatamab efficacy with an acceptable safety profile.3 Together, these findings support a clinical study of tarlatamab in NEPC. Methods: NCT04702737 is an open-label, phase 1b study evaluating tarlatamab infusion in pts with metastatic de novo or treatment-emergent NEPC, consisting of dose exploration and then dose expansion. Key eligibility criteria include adults (≥18 y) with metastatic NEPC whose disease progressed/recurred after ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy (platinum-based regimen for de novo NEPC or an ASI if treatment-emergent), measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 with Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 modifications, and ECOG performance status ≤2. Primary objectives are to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose of tarlatamab. Secondary objectives are to evaluate antitumor activity (as assessed by objective response, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and disease control rate) and characterize pharmacokinetics.

       "  'TPS198Background: Despite recent advances, nearly all patients (pts) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) experience disease progression and cancer-specific mortality. Persistent or reactivated androgen receptor (AR) signaling and/or activation of pathways in cross-talk with AR signaling are key drivers of mCRPC progression. Evidence suggests that AR signaling promotes translation of D-type cyclins resulting in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4&6) activation and cell cycle progression. Abemaciclib is an oral selective inhibitor of CDK4&6 dosed on a continuous schedule, that is FDA-approved in combination with endocrine therapy or as monotherapy to treat HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer pts. Preclinical studies with prostate cancer cell lines and xenograft models showed that abemaciclib induces cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition. The hypothesis is that addition of abemaciclib to AR targeted therapy may be an effective treatment for mCRPC pts. Methods: CYCLONE 2 (NCT03706365) is a phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of abemaciclib in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA+P) in pts with mCRPC. CYCLONE 2 is an adaptive study which is designed in three parts. Part 1 is a 30-patient safety lead-in to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D; 150 mg or 200 mg, twice daily) of abemaciclib in combination with AA (1000 mg, once daily) + P (5 mg, twice daily). In part 2, 150 pts are randomized 1:1 to AA+P with abemaciclib at the RP2D or placebo. The study expands to enroll an additional 170 pts in Part 3 if prespecified expansion criteria are met at a planned adaptive interim analysis performed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). Pts with mCRPC evidenced by radiographic and/or PSA progression during continuous ADT are eligible. Prior docetaxel for mHSPC is permitted. Systemic anti-cancer therapy for mCRPC and prior novel hormonal agents are exclusionary. The primary objective is radiographic progression free survival (rPFS; per RECIST1.1 for soft tissue and PCWG3 for bone). Secondary objectives include safety, objective response rate, duration of response, time to symptomatic and PSA progression, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics. Status: Enrollment in Part 1 & 2 is completed. Based on the recommendation from the IDMC, Part 3 was opened in June 2021 and enrolls pts from about 112 sites across 12 countries.

With the emerging role of PSMA-PET/CT in diagnostic staging, identification of this disease status is increasing. The superior border for prostate nodal radiotherapy is variable across different centres. PEARLS (CRUK/19/016) aims to show that extending the radiotherapy field to cover the para-aortic LN (up to L1/L2 vertebral interspace) can improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients with PSMA-avid pelvic LN at presentation. The trial is registered: ISRCTN36344989. Methods: PEARLS is a multi‐stage randomised controlled trial. Men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer with PSMA‐avid nodal disease within the pelvis +/‐ para‐aortic region receiving androgen deprivation therapy +/‐ androgen receptor targeted therapy or docetaxel chemotherapy are eligible. Two cohorts defined by extent of LN disease determined by PSMA‐PET/CT will be recruited: cohort A (pelvic LN at or below the L4/L5 vertebral interspace) and cohort B (para-aortic LN below L1/L2 vertebral interspace). Patients are randomly allocated (1:1) to standard field (dependent on cohort) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) (control) or extended-field IMRT (experimental) in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. In the control group, cohort A will receive 60Gy to the prostate and 44Gy to the pelvis with an integrated boost of 51Gy to PSMA-avid LN and cohort B will receive 60Gy to the prostate only. In the experimental group, participants in both cohorts will receive 60Gy to the prostate and 44Gy to the pelvis and para‐aortic region with an integrated boost of 51Gy to involved LN. In phase II, the primary endpoint is lower gastrointestinal RTOG grade 2+ toxicity at week 18 from start of radiotherapy. Assuming acceptable toxicity in the first 75 participants receiving extended-field IMRT, the study will move to phase III where the primary endpoint is metastasis‐free survival. The trial aims to recruit 714 patients with pelvic LN to detect a hazard ratio of 0.62 in favour of extended-field IMRT and a further 179 patients with para‐aortic LN disease. The trial was launched in the UK on 25 June 2021. Phase II will be conducted in 20 NHS Trusts across the UK. Clinical trial information: ISRCTN36344989.',\n",

       "  'TPS200Background: Previous randomized, phase 3 trials have shown the efficacy of adding docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or apalutamide to ADT in improving overall survival and/or radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, these combinations are associated with an increased risk of adverse events (eg, fatigue, rash, and cardiovascular events). Darolutamide is a structurally distinct and highly potent androgen receptor inhibitor. In the ARAMIS study, darolutamide has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of death by 31% and have a favorable safety profile in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It has a low incidence of central nervous system−related adverse events, which may be explained by its distinct low blood−brain barrier penetration. Darolutamide has also been shown to have a low potential for drug−drug interactions, allowing flexibility with concomitant medications. ARANOTE will evaluate the efficacy and safety of darolutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC (NCT04736199). Methods: ARANOTE is an international, multicenter (ex-US), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and documented metastatic disease by conventional imaging (eg, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) who started ADT ≤12 weeks before randomization. In total, 555 patients will be randomized 2:1 to darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, plus ADT. Patients will be stratified by the presence of visceral metastases, assessed by central review, and prior local therapy. Patients will be evaluated every 12 weeks for efficacy, safety, and quality of life (using the FACT-P questionnaire) during treatment and active follow-up post treatment. For long-term follow-up, patients will be contacted by telephone every 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is rPFS; secondary endpoints include overall survival, time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, time to prostate-specific antigen progression, and safety. Recruitment is ongoing, and the first patient first visit was on February 23, 2021. The estimated study completion date is September 2025. Clinical trial information: NCT04736199.',\n",

       "  'TPS201Background: Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI), such as enzalutamide (Enza), and abiraterone (Abi), are standard therapies for metastatic hormone-sensitive and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mHSPC, mCRPC). Patients who respond to the initial ARSI are frequently prescribed a second ARSI upon progression. However, a suboptimal response to first line ARSI, including the ̃ 20% treated with an ARSI for mHSPC who progress within 12 months of treatment initiation, may enrich for cancers harboring AR-independent mechanisms of resistance including treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC). Recently, BETi have been shown pre-clinically to block the neuroendocrine prostate cancer lineage plasticity program through modulating E2F1, a transcription factor involved in stemness and cell differentiation. Prior results from a mCRPC Ph. 1b/2a trial of ZEN-3694+ Enza support this notion, as lower AR transcriptional activity in baseline tumor biopsies was associated with longer radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Additionally, mCRPC patients who were primary refractory to first-line abiraterone had prolonged rPFS with ZEN-3694 + Enza, suggesting that the patients with primary resistance may benefit from the combination. To test this hypothesis, a Ph. 2b randomized trial has been initiated, enriching for mCRPC with suboptimal response to first-line ARSI. Methods: This is a multi-national, open-label, randomized, two cohort, Ph. 2b study of ZEN-3694 + Enza vs. Enza in mCRPC patients who have progressed on Abi (NCT04986423). Cohort A (N = 150): Patients with poor response to Abi defined either as progression in < 12 months or failure to achieve PSA nadir of 0.2 ng/mL while taking Abi in HSPC setting, or progression in < 6 months and/or failure to achieve a PSA50 response while taking Abi in the CRPC setting. Cohort B (N = 50): Patients who responded to Abi, defined as > 12 months duration without progression while on Abi in the HSPC setting and achieving a nadir PSA < 0.2 ng/mL, or > 6 months duration without progression while on Abi in the CRPC setting and confirmed PSA50 response. The primary endpoint is radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in Cohort A evaluated by PCWG3. Key secondary endpoints include rPFS by BICR for Cohorts A + B, PFS by investigator assessment, overall survival, PSA50 response rate, objective response rate by RECIST 1.1, and patient-reported health status and quality of life, evaluated in Cohorts A, and Cohorts A + B together. The trial, conducted in collaboration with Newsoara is expected to enroll 200 participants, and the first patient was dosed in October 2021. Astellas is providing the enzalutamide for this study.

       "  'TPS202Background: Approximately 30% of patients (pts) treated with definitive surgical and/or radiation therapy for localized prostate adenocarcinoma develop biochemical recurrence (BCR). The optimal time to initiate androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for such patients is controversial and depends on patient and provider preference, absolute PSA value, and PSA doubling time (PSADT), which has been associated with time to metastasis. Because the time from BCR to metastasis can be long in many cases, strategies allowing pts to avoid ADT while extending metastasis-free survival are desirable. Prior studies have shown that a high tumor neoantigen load correlates with response to anti-PD(L)1. We hypothesized that PARP inhibitor-induced genomic instability may sensitize tumors to anti-PD(L)1 through: i) increasing mutational burden and subsequent tumor neoantigen formation, and/or ii) through activation of other immunogenic pathways (e.g. the STING pathway). This trial investigates an ADT-sparing approach for men predicted to have high neoantigen load and who have BCR prostate cancer. Methods: This is a phase 2 clinical trial testing durvalumab (1500 mg IV every 4 weeks) and olaparib (300 mg PO twice a day) (one cycle = 4 weeks) in men with BCR (PSADT≤10 months) whose tumors are predicted to have high neoantigen load based on: biallelic CDK12 mutations (Cohort A), mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd)/high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) (Cohort B), or loss of function mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (Cohort C). Cohorts A and B will receive 3 cycles of durvalumab followed by 3 cycles of the combination of durvalumab and olaparib. Given the proven efficacy of olaparib in prostate cancer patient whose tumors posses an HRR gene mutation, Cohort C will receive 6 full cycles of the combination. Ten patients will be enrolled in each cohort (total n = 30) at two collaborating sites. This study was designed to provide preliminary efficacy data across eligible cohorts, with a primary objective of estimating the proportion of pts with an undetectable PSA at 12 months within each cohort. Secondary objectives include safety, proportion of patients with ≥50% decline in PSA from baseline and quality of life measures. Correlative studies will assess blood and tissue molecular biomarkers for association with outcomes. The study is open with two patients enrolled at the time of abstract submission.

       "  'TPS203Background: Two diverging paradigms have been studied in recent years to improve the survival of men with recurrent metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). First, multiple recent phase II randomized trials have demonstrated improved long-term progression-free survival (PFS) with metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) in men with oligorecurrent PCa in the absence of systemic therapy. Yet, most patients receiving MDT for oligorecurrent PCa develop progression in new areas, arguing that systemic therapy is needed to treat occult metastases. The second approach that has recently been studied is whether escalating systemic therapy by adding novel androgen receptor axis targeted agents or chemotherapy improves outcomes in men with metastatic PCa. Multiple phase III randomized trials demonstrate that enhancing hormonal therapy with these therapeutic agents improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Therefore, these agents have been integrated into today’s standard systemic therapy (SST) for metastatic recurrence, and SST is the current NCCN guidelines standard of care for recurrent metastatic PCa. The primary goal of our study is to determine if adding PET-directed local therapy (PDLT) to SST improves disease control compared to SST alone in Veterans with oligorecurrent PCa. Methods: VA STARPORT is a phase II/III randomized trial open at 16 VA medical centers comparing SST with or without PDLT in Veterans with oligorecurrent PCa. Key eligibility criteria include prior localized PCa with biochemical recurrence after initial curative-intent local therapy and workup including any FDA-approved PCa PET/CT that reveals oligorecurrence in 1-5 metastatic lesions. The primary endpoint is castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-free survival). Secondary endpoints include radiographic PFS, clinical PFS, freedom from index lesion progression, toxicity, quality of life, and prostate cancer-specific and overall survival. SST is delivered with an intent for indefinite SST using any NCCN guideline-concordant regimen in both arms. PDLT (Arm 2) consists of surgery or radiation to metastases and any present prostate/prostate bed local recurrence. Metastasis-directed radiation can consist of stereotactic body radiotherapy or elective nodal radiotherapy per clinician discretion from dose/fractionation options defined in the protocol. All participants undergo somatic tumor sequencing using the VA National Precision Oncology Program. Germline sequencing and tumor banking in a separate biorepository study is recommended. Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.60 for SST + PDLT vs SST, two-sided alpha = 0.05 and 90% power, a total of 464 participants will be randomized to generate 166 primary events (CRPC-free survival) by the end of the 48-month active study phase.

Approximately 20% of patients with adenocarcinoma mCRPC that progresses on androgen deprivation therapy develop t-NE mCRPC, which is associated with shortened overall survival (OS). The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab showed antitumor activity as monotherapy in docetaxel-pretreated patients with adenocarcinoma mCRPC in the phase 2 KEYNOTE-199 trial. The T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) inhibitor vibostolimab showed antitumor activity when combined with pembrolizumab in pretreated patients with several tumor types in a phase 1 dose-escalation study. Combining PD-1 and TIGIT inhibition might have enhanced benefit in mCRPC, potentially both adenocarcinoma and t-NE. Methods: KEYNOTE-365 (NCT02861573) is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicohort, phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of several pembrolizumab combination therapies in patients with mCRPC. Patients enrolled in cohort G will have confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell histology, per the investigator. Cohort H will enroll patients with t-NE (≥1% neuroendocrine cells in a recent biopsy specimen confirmed by central histology review). Each cohort will include patients who previously received docetaxel treatment for mCRPC. Prior treatment with ≤2 NHAs (for hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer [mHSPC] or mCRPC) and 1 other chemotherapy for mCRPC is permitted. Enrollment in cohort H requires prostate cancer progression within 6 months of starting an NHA (for mHSPC or mCRPC) and within < 6 cycles of docetaxel for mCRPC. Each cohort will enroll 40-100 patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score 0 or 1. Both cohorts will receive MK-7684A, a coformulation of pembrolizumab 200 mg and vibostolimab 200 mg, IV every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or other discontinuation event.

Pre-clinical studies have shown that androgen receptor blockade with enzalutamide upregulates PSMA-receptor expression, and that PSMA-receptor blockade increases treatment response to enzalutamide. We hypothesize that concurrent administration of LuPSMA and enzalutamide will be synergistic in mCRPC. The aims of ENZA-p are to determine the activity and safety of LuPSMA combined with enzalutamide in men with mCRPC at high-risk of early progression on enzalutamide alone; and to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers from imaging, blood, and tissue. Methods: This open-label, randomized, multicentre, phase 2 trial will recruit 160 men with mCRPC. Key eligibility criteria include progression on androgen deprivation therapy, 2 or more risk factors for early cancer progression on enzalutamide (LDH ≥ULN; ALP ≥ULN; albumin < 35 g/L; M1 disease at diagnosis; < 3 years since initial diagnosis; > 5 bone metastases; visceral metastases; PSA doubling time < 3 months; pain requiring opiates > 14 days; for castration-sensitive disease), no prior treatment with an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (except abiraterone), no prior chemotherapy for mCRPC, and PSMA-avid disease on positron emission tomography (PET) with 68Ga-PSMA. Participants are randomly assigned (1:1) to enzalutamide 160 mg daily or enzalutamide 160 mg daily plus LuPSMA 7.5 GBq on days 15 and 57. Two subsequent doses of Lu-PSMA will be administered if the 68Ga-PSMA PET on day 92 shows persistent PSMA expression in the tumour. Imaging assessments include CT and technetium bone scan at baseline, day 99, then every 12 weeks; 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET at baseline, days 15, 92, and first progression; and 18F FDG PET at baseline and first progression. Translational samples including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and biopsies (optional) will be collected at baseline, day 92, and first progression. The primary endpoint is PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS). Secondary endpoints include radiological-PFS, PSA-response rate, pain response and PFS, clinical-PFS, overall survival, health related quality of life, adverse events, and cost-effectiveness. Correlative studies include identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers from 68Ga-PSMA, 18F FDG PET/CT, CTCs, and ctDNA.

Key eligibility criteria: mCRPC with histologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, adequate organ function based on hematology and serum chemistry, and 1 or more prior novel androgen receptor-targeted therapies (prior chemotherapy acceptable). Key exclusion criteria: prior treatment with radium/strontium/samarium/radioconjugate therapy, superscan findings as protocol defined, active central nervous system metastases. In Part 1, men will receive intravenous (IV) injection of 50 μCi/ 2 mg JNJ-420 (once every 8 weeks) with one or multiple doses; escalation of dose levels to be based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) evaluation, until RP2D identification. In Part 2, JNJ-420 is to be given at one of the RP2D(s) determined in Part 1. Primary endpoint is safety (incidence and severity [grading per NCI-CTCAE V5.0] of AEs including DLTs). Secondary endpoints include prostate specific antigen response rate, overall response rate (PCWG3 modified RECIST 1.1 criteria), PK, PD, immunogenicity, and biomarker analyses. Enrollment began in Dec 2020; as of Sep 2021, 4 sites have been initiated and 14 pts enrolled; currently, dose escalation is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT04644770.',\n",

       "  'TPS207Background: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs or receptor antagonists is a cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. As disease progresses, agents with complementary mechansims are co-prescribed with ADT to suppress extra-testicular testosterone production or block androgen receptors on cancer cells. Relugolix (120 mg) is an oral non-peptide GnRH receptor antagonist approved in the US for the treatment of aPC. In the phase 3 study, relugolix maintained suppression of testosterone to castration levels in 96.7% of men for up to 48 weeks (wks), with superiority to leuprolide acetate. Relugolix was well tolerated and associated with a 54% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events relative to leuprolide acetate (Shore N, NEJM 2020;382;23). To formally assess the safety and tolerability of combination treatment with relugolix, a phase 1 study in men with aPC has been undertaken. Methods: This is a three-part, open-label, parallel-cohort safety and tolerability study of relugolix in combination with abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Part 1), apalutamide in men with mCSPC or non-metastatic catration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) (Part 2), or docetaxel in men with mCSPC or mCRPC (Part 3). Each part of the study consists of a 45-day screening period, a 12-wk primary study treatment period and a 40-wk safety extension treatment period. All of the men are required to have been treated with leuprolide acetate or a GnRH receptor antagonist (eg, degarelix) in combination with abiraterone acetate for a minimum of 12 wks, apalutamide for a minimum of 6 wks, or docetaxel for a minimum of one treatment cycle prior to the baseline (Day 1) visit. Men will be transitioned from leuprolide acetate or degarelix to relugolix (120 mg [Part 1 and 3] or 240 mg [Part 2] once daily after a single loading dose of 360 mg); on the approximate date the next analog or antagonist injection is scheduled; treatment with each combination treatment will continue as previously prescribed. Hence, the study will provide safety and tolerability of relugolix and the three different combination agents for up to 1 year and in addition, will provide safety and tolerability data as men transition from injectable leuprolide acetate or degarelix to oral treatment with relugolix. Enrollment into the study began in March 2021. A protocol amendment was approved in July 2021 to include Part 2 and Part 3 of the study and to add the 40-wk safety extension treatment period. Screening for Part 2 was initiated in August 2021 and for Part 3 it is expected to initiate in January 2022. Clinical trial information: NCT04666129.',\n",

       "  \"TPS208Background: Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an immunologically cold tumor, with a 5% response rate reported to the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. VEGF secreted by tumors may play a key role in hindering the anti-tumor immune response, leading to the development of an abnormal vasculature that may limit immune surveillance. VEGF also inhibits dendritic cell differentiation, limiting the presentation of tumor antigens. The inhibition of VEGF may therefore potentiate the effect of PD-1/L1 directed therapy by enabling immune surveillance and antigen presentation. VEGF-TKI and checkpoint inhibitor combinations are currently approved in the treatment of advanced kidney, cervical, and endometrial cancers. This signal-seeking study aims to determine whether the combination of the VEGF-TKI tivozanib and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab may be effective in CRPC and certain other immunologically cold tumors. Methods: The trial is a single center phase Ib/II basket study in multiple immunologically cold tumors. Co-primary endpoints are safety and the overall response rate as measured via RECIST v1.1. The tivozanib dose will be determined via a 3+3 dose de-escalation phase Ib portion. Patients treated in the phase Ib portion will be included as study subjects for phase the II portion. The study is designed to test for a 25%+ response rate as compared to a null hypothesis of <7% (one-sided alpha = 0.05; 80% power). A Simon’s two-stage design will be utilized and if ≥2 responses among the first 16 evaluable patients, a further 10 evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 26. Up to 33 subjects will be enrolled to account for a 20% dropout rate. The null hypothesis will be rejected if at least 5 responses are observed. The University of Florida's Data Integrity and Safety Committee will review significant adverse events. Tivozanib will be given at a dose of 1.34 mg/day for 21 days of each 28-day cycle (potential dose reduction is to 0.89 mg/day). Atezolizumab is given at a dose of 1,680 mg every 28 days. Treatment is until disease progression or intolerance. Key inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of certain advanced and unresectable or metastatic immunologically cold tumors (CRPC previously treated with an androgen inhibitor or cytotoxic chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting, bile duct or gallbladder cancer, certain HR-negative HER2-positive breast cancers, ovarian cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or vulvar cancer), at least one prior systemic therapy in this setting, ECOG 0-1 (phase Ib) or ECOG 0-2 (phase II), age ≥ 18, adequate hematologic and end-organ function, life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, and measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. Key exclusion criteria include known mismatch repair deficiency, microsatellite instability, or high tumor mutational burden. Active enrollment continues.

       "  'TPS209Background: Multiple lines of evidence suggest a crosstalk between androgen receptor (AR) signaling and DNA damage repair (DDR) in prostate cancer. Co-targeting both pathways in mHNPC can result in a clinically relevant synergistic effect. ZZFIRST trial is evaluating the combination of TALA –a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor– and EZ –an AR signaling inhibitor– in mHNPC patients. Methods: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial. Men aged ≥18 years with histologically confirmed mHNPC, an ECOG performance status of 0-1, and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥4 ng/mL at enrolment are eligible. Patients must have not received previous systemic treatment for locally advanced or mHNPC. A total of 54 patients will start treatment with EZ 160 mg/day for 2 28-day cycles in addition to standard androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients are then randomized and stratified based on homologous recombination gene alterations on a 1:2 ratio to either continue EZ 160 mg/day, or to receive EZ 160 mg/day plus TALA 0.5 mg/day. In both arms, patients will continue ADT throughout the trial. Treatment will continue until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. PSA will be determined every 4 weeks and radiological tumor extend will be assessed at screening and every 8 weeks for the 6 initial months of treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter until PD. Primary endpoint is PSA-complete response defined as the percentage of patients with PSA < 0.2 ng/mL at 12 months of therapy. Secondary endpoints include PSA-complete response at any time point and at month 7, PSA response ( < 4 ng/ml) at 7 and 12 months, PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiologic PFS, time to castration resistance based on PSA-PFS and rPFS, and overall survival. Safety will be assessed as per NCI-CTCAE 5.0. Exploratory endpoints include analysis of transcriptional changes in AR and DDR pathways and assessment of genomic signatures on tumor and liquid biopsies collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and PD. An imaging sub-study of whole-body diffusion weighted MRI will help to further study antitumor activity and drug resistance mechanisms. This trial was opened to accrual in July 2020. Currently 44 patients have been enrolled (with 37 randomized by cycle 3 day 1) out of 54 expected. Analysis will be assessed with the exact binomial test. At least 11 patients must maintain PSA < 0.2 ng/mL by 12 months of therapy among 32 evaluable patients in the combination arm to justify further investigation of this strategy. A drop-out rate of 10% has been considered. Clinical trial information: NCT04332744.',\n",

Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI) may alter PSMA expression and radiosensitivity. PSMAddition will assess the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone in adults with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Methods: PSMAddition (NCT04720157) is an international, prospective, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial in adults with mHSPC. Eligible patients are treatment-naïve or minimally treated candidates for hormonal therapy, with PSMA-positive disease (determined by [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate major organ function. Patients are excluded if they have rapidly progressing tumors that require chemotherapy. Approximately 1126 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq i.v. every 6 weeks, ≤6 cycles) plus SOC or SOC alone (control arm). SOC is ARPI and androgen deprivation therapy. Stratification factors are tumor volume (high/low), age (≥70/ < 70 years) and previous/planned prostatectomy or radiation treatment of the primary prostate tumor (yes/no). The primary endpoint is radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), as assessed by blinded independent centralized review. Upon centrally confirmed radiographic progression, participants in the control arm can cross over to the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm. The planned sample size provides 95% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 for rPFS after 418 events with an overall one-sided significance level of 0.025. The key secondary endpoint is overall survival. Other secondary endpoints are the proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥90% from baseline, time to development of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, composite progression-free survival (radiographic, clinical or PSA progression), safety and tolerability, and health-related quality of life.

The combination of immunotherapy (IO) with radiation therapy might provide a clinical benefit to patients with recurrent prostate cancer due to an induction of increased activity of the immune system against cancerous tissue (abscopal effect). Primary endpoint is complete biochemical response (PSA level below detection level) 60 weeks after start of trial treatment, which further defines prognosis of patients. Further explorative endpoints like radiographic progression-free survival, PSA-nadir level and time to PSA-nadir, time to initiation of subsequent therapy (secondary ADT or NHA) and quality of life as well as adverse events will be evaluated. Methods: The trial is as a phase II, open-label, single arm monocenter trial which evaluates the combination of pembrolizumab as study medication in combination with SRT. Pembrolizumab will be administered in a three-weekly scheme up to one year of treatment. A concomitant ADT is administered in high-risk patients only (PSA > 0.7ng/ml or cN+ in imaging studies). All patients will be staged with PSMA PET-CT, if applicable. Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for correlative biomarker studies. A total of 49 patients are planned to be enrolled in this explorative study within 2 years.

Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6i) have revolutionized the therapeutic landscape in ER+ breast cancer and have demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in multiple pre-clinical mCRPC models such as enzalutamide-resistant cell lines, including those with the androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7). Pre-clinical synergy has also been seen in multiple studies of CDK4/6i and anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand-1 (PD-L1). Additionally, loss of function alterations of CDK12, found in 5-7% of mCRPC, may confer vulnerability to anti-PD-L1 agents. Methods: This multi-center study will enroll 54 unselected mCRPC patients (pts), randomized 1:1 to abema (arm A) or abema + atezo (arm B); and 21 pts with known loss of function mutations in CDK12 (arm C) treated with atezo (n = 5) or abema + atezo (n = 16). All pts will undergo on-treatment (6-week) tumor biopsy. Treatment will be continued until disease progression and crossover is prohibited. Key eligibility criteria are age ≥ 18 years, ECOG PS 0-1, biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma, progressive metastatic disease per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), progression/intolerance to ≥ 1 novel antiandrogen in hormone-sensitive or CRPC setting, ineligible for docetaxel/cabazitaxel (progression within 12 months of taxane, pt refusal, investigator discretion), no uncontrolled comorbidity or history of pneumonitis/ILD. Arms A & B will use two stage design for co-primary endpoints of progression-free survival at 6 months using PCWG3 (6m-PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). If ≥ 1/12 pts meet either co-primary endpoint, 2nd stage will open to enroll 15 more pts in that arm. Treatment will be deemed to have meaningful clinical activity (MCA) if ≥ 6/27 meet 6m-PFS or ≥ 5/27 have an ORR. This will provide 86% power for 6m-PFS (34% vs. 12%) and 85% power for ORR (30% vs. 10%) at a one-sided α = 0.08. For MCA in arm C, 16 patients treated with abema+atezo will provide 80-85% power for 6m-PFS (34% vs. 12%) at a one-sided α = 0.05 using a one-sample log-rank test. Primary safety endpoint is the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in pts receiving abema+atezo. Key secondary endpoints are clinical benefit rate (ORR + stable disease), duration of response and overall survival in arms A and B, and safety events in all arms. Primary exploratory endpoint is comparison of tumoral FoxP3+/CD8+ ratio in pts treated with abema vs. abema + atezo. Additional exploratory endpoints will evaluate association between response and genomic alterations identified from tissue or circulating tumor-derived exosomes.

       "  'TPS214Background: Multiple systemic therapies have resulted in improved overall survival (OS) for mHSPC, including several AR-targeted agents (ARTA) and docetaxel chemotherapy. However, patients (pts) with high volume de novo metastatic prostate cancer still only have an OS of approximately 50 months. Thus, more effective combination strategies for initial treatment of mHSPC are urgently needed. CABO, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (including MET, VEGFR-1, -2,-3, AXL) has shown synergy with ABI as well as with CPI in preclinical studies. CABO and ABI have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Choudhury et\\xa0al Prostate 2018), and CABO and atezolizumab (ATEZO) in combination have showed a promising efficacy signal and manageable safety profile in mCRPC (COSMIC-021, NCT03170960; Agarwal ESMO 2021). The phase 3 CONTACT-02 trial (NCT04446117) is randomizing mCRPC pts to either CABO and ATEZO or a second generation ARTA. Given the robust preclinical and emerging clinical data for the use of both CABO and CPI therapy in advanced prostate cancer and the need to optimize therapy earlier in the course of disease, in the present trial we intend to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ABI, CABO, and CPI in mHSPC. Methods: CABIOS (NCT04477512) is a phase Ib, single center, open label trial of ABI, CABO and the CPI nivolumab (NIVO), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in pts with mHSPC. Key inclusion criteria include histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine/small cell differentiation and radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Ongoing androgen deprivation (ADT) within 12 weeks of study start is allowed. Key exclusion criteria include evidence of castration resistance, prior treatment with second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors, CYP17 inhibitors, CABO, or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4), active autoimmune disease, and ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids daily. The primary objective of the trial is evaluation of the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy in the trial population; the primary endpoint is the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) as measured by CTCAE v5.0. The study will employ a 3 + 3 design evaluating ABI 1,000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg daily, NIVO 480 mg IV every 4 weeks, and a CABO starting dose of 20 mg once daily at dose level 1 (DL1). If 0 of 3 pts at DL1 experience a DLT, 3 pts will be enrolled at DL2 with CABO 40 mg once daily. If 1 of 3 pts at DL1 experience a DLT, 3 additional pts will be enrolled at DL1. If 0 of 3 pts experience a DLT at DL2, the study will move to a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) expansion cohort. Total sample size of approximately 20 pts is expected depending on DLT frequencies. Enrollment is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT04477512.',\n",

       "  'TPS215Background: Standard of care for noncurative adenocarcinoma mCRPC is docetaxel or the next-generation hormonal agents (NHAs) abiraterone and enzalutamide. However, approximately 20% of patients develop t-NE after treatment for adenocarcinoma mCRPC; t-NE is associated with shorter survival, and it has no standard of care beyond combination platinum chemotherapy. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor lenvatinib inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis in preclinical models of adenocarcinoma prostate cancer. The phase 2 KEYNOTE-199 trial showed some antitumor activity with pembrolizumab monotherapy in docetaxel-pretreated patients with adenocarcinoma mCRPC. VEGF/FGFR inhibition combined with PD-1 inhibition may have enhanced benefit in mCRPC, for adenocarcinoma and possibly as a new treatment option for t-NE. Methods: KEYNOTE-365 (NCT02861573) is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicohort, phase 1b/2 trial designed to evaluate different pembrolizumab combination therapies in several patient populations with mCRPC. Cohort E will enroll patients with confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without small cell histology, per investigator. Cohort F will enroll patients with t-NE (≥1% neuroendocrine cells in a recent biopsy specimen confirmed by central histology review). Each cohort will include patients who previously received docetaxel treatment for mCRPC. Prior treatment with ≤2 NHAs (for hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer [mHSPC] or mCRPC) and 1 other chemotherapy for mCRPC is permitted. Additionally, enrollment in cohort F requires prostate cancer progression within 6 months of starting an NHA (for mHSPC or mCRPC) and within < 6 cycles of docetaxel for mCRPC. Each cohort will enroll 40-100 patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1. Both cohorts will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks + oral lenvatinib 20 mg once daily until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, prespecified alanine aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransaminase level increase, or other discontinuation event. Primary end points are safety and tolerability, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, and objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary end points include time to PSA progression; ORR and radiographic progression-free survival per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)–modified RECIST v1.1 by BICR; duration of response and disease control rate per RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3-modified RECIST v1.1 by BICR; and overall survival.

       "  'TPS216Background: The role of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in prostate cancer remains undefined outside of the subset with mismatch repair. Several studies have suggested that ICI combined with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) or kinase inhibitors may result in improved and/or more durable response in a proportion of men with mCRPC. While not yet proven, addition of external beam radiation to ICI may improve outcomes (for instance Kwon et\\xa0al Lancet Oncol 2014, Fizazi K et\\xa0al, Eur Urol 2020). PSMA targeted therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 improves survival in men with CRPC, has been combined with ICI in early phase studies, and we have previously demonstrated the benefit of PSMA targeted therapy using radiolabeled mAb J591. PSMA-targeted alpha-emitters have a very high potency and the potential to generate immune response. Based upon i) ARSI may increase PSMA expression, ii) ARSI may radiosensitize tumors, iii) ARSI resistance may lead to increased PD-L1 expression, and iv) alpha emitters may generate an immune response, we hypothesize that the addition of an alpha-emitting radionuclide (225Ac) targeting prostate cancer (i.e PSMA+ tumors targeted with J591) will lead to double-stranded DNA breaks, cell death, and subsequent release of neoantigens, and thus will increase the response proportion to pembrolizumab plus ARSI resulting in more durable response. Methods: Key eligibility criteria include progressive mCRPC by PCWG3 on at least 1 prior AR pathway inhibitor and no prior chemotherapy for mCRPC. A phase I dose-finding study will first test safety of the triplet combination of pembrolizumab, an ARSI of physician choice, and 2 different doses of 225Ac-J591 (one with minimal and one with moderate single-agent toxicity). Following determination of the optimal dose, a randomized phase II trial will treat subjects with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks (for up to 2 years) plus a standard ARSI (until progression or intolerance) with or without 225Ac-J591. The primary endpoint of the study will test the hypothesis that the addition of a PSMA-targeted alpha emitter increases the composite of RECIST measurable disease, PSA, and CTC count response to immuno-hormonal therapy with 90% power. Key secondary clinical endpoints include 1-year progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival. Exploratory objectives include assessment of immunogenic cell death, immune serologic and host microbiome changes, plasma ctDNA, serial PSMA PET, and patient reported outcomes (FACT-P, BPI, EQ-5D-5L). The phase I portion of this DOD-funded study was activated in summer 2021 with the randomized phase II portion expected to open at PCCTC sites in 2022. Clinical trial information: NCT04946370.',\n",

       "  'TPS217Background: Sabizabulin is a first-in-class, oral agent that inhibits microtubule polymerization disrupting the cytoskeleton and arresting cellular proliferation. In prostate cancer, targeted inhibition of microtubule polymerization further blocks the transport of the androgen receptor into the nucleus. A phase 1b/2 clinical study was conducted to establish the MTD and evaluate the preliminary efficacy in men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed on at least one androgen receptor targeting agent (ARTA). The most common AEs reported were mild to moderate diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting with no clinically relevant neurotoxicity or neutropenia. In the phase 1b/2, in all evaluable patients that would qualify for the VERACITY study (n=26), the ORR was 23.1%. Median radiographic progression free survival was >12 months (range 6-28+ months) in the phase 1b portion including responses >two years. The revised formulation for use in the Phase 3 study, with improved bioavailability, is 32mg PO qd. Methods: VERACITY is an ongoing phase 3 multicenter, randomized, active-control study designed to evaluate sabizabulin in the treatment of mCRPC who have progressed on at least one ARTA. Patients on the study will be chemotherapy naive. Subjects (n=245) are being randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive sabizabulin (32 mg/d oral) or active control (alternative ARTA) and will remain on study until radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Randomization will be stratified by: measurable disease vs. bone-only disease and by prior exposure to ARTA (progressed on one vs more than one prior ARTA). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is median rPFS. Secondary endpoints include: objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response, overall survival and time to intravenous (IV) chemotherapy. The phase 3, VERACITY registration clinical trial is current ongoing in approximately 45 clinical sites with enrollment anticipated to be completed in 2022 and with unblinded results presented in 2023. Based upon the phase 1b/2 clinical trial, sabizabulin daily chronic oral dosing has a favorable safety profile, is feasible to administer chronically, and has significant and durable antitumor activity. Metastatic prostate cancer that has become refractory to newer generation ARTAs and prior to IV chemotherapy, remains an urgent unmet medical need for patients with advanced disease. Sabizabulin is an exciting first-in-class agent that will add to the armamentarium for the treatment of metastatic castration and ARTA resistant prostate cancer.

In the open-label, multicohort, phase 1b/2 KEYNOTE-365 study (NCT02861573), pembrolizumab, when combined with several agents for treatment of adenocarcinoma mCRPC, showed clinical activity and acceptable safety. To identify new treatment options for t-NE mCRPC, cohort I will help to evaluate platinum-containing chemotherapy alone or combined with pembrolizumab for patients with t-NE. Methods: Cohort I of the KEYNOTE-365 study will enroll patients with t-NE (≥1% neuroendocrine cells in a recent biopsy specimen confirmed by central histology review) and prior docetaxel treatment for mCRPC. Prior treatment with ≤2 next-generation hormonal agents (NHAs) for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) or mCRPC and 1 other chemotherapy for mCRPC is permitted.

       "  'TPS219Background: Metastatic CRPC is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Although abiraterone (abi) + prednisone in either castration-sensitive or castration-resistant disease increases survival, resistance is universal and generally occurs within 9-16 months of initiating treatment. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates mitotic function and is upregulated in prostate cancer following androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Onvansertib is an oral and highly-selective PLK1 inhibitor that demonstrated safety and tolerability as a single agent in a Ph1 trial. Preclinical studies showed that PLK1 inhibition enhanced abi anti-tumor effect in cell line models and in patient-derived tumor xenografts via an AR-independent mechanism. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that abi induced mitosis-related gene sets in cells synergistic for abi + onvansertib, and identified an abi-onvansertib synergy gene signature. Methods: The goal of this phase 2 study (NCT03414034) is to observe the effects of onvansertib + abi on disease control, as assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline or stabilization after 12 weeks of study treatment, in subjects with mCRPC and early resistance to abi. Patients are enrolled at time of PSA progression while on standard abi. Prior treatment with enzalutamide or apalutamide is not permitted. Three onvansertib dosing schedules are tested in noncomparative arms: arm A (24 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle), arm B (18 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 14-day cycle), and arm C (12 mg/m2 on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle). To-date, 24 patients were enrolled in Arm A, and 20 patients each in Arms B and C. With 32 patients in each arm, there will be 90% power to detect a change in disease-control rate from 10% (null) to 30% (alternative). Based on a Simon’s two-stage optimal design, the study will terminate early if < 2 of the first 13 patients in each arm achieve disease control. Exploratory analyses include evaluation of the presence of the androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) in circulating tumor cells and targeted genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA to assess associations between genomic alterations and response to treatment.

ADT is associated with significant adverse effects in this asymptomatic population, and hence there is an unmet need for alternate non-hormonal options. Androgen receptor (AR) and its variants (AR-V) are persistently expressed in the majority of the cells in recurrent PCs and drives PC growth. Jak2-Stat5 signaling has been shown to sustain PC cell viability and is critical for PC tumor growth. Stat5 activation in PC at the time of surgery predicts early PC recurrence. Our investigation of the molecular targets downstream of Jak2-Stat5 signaling have revealed the AR gene as a critical target, and the Jak2-Stat5 pathway represents a target to inhibit expression of diverse AR and AR-V species and thereby control of PC growth. Pacritinib (PAC) is a novel JAK2 inhibitor that suppresses wild-type Jak2 in cell-based assays and has demonstrated promising antitumor activity in myelofibrosis. We hypothesize that PAC inhibition of Jak2-Stat5 signaling will induce biochemical responses in men with recurrent PC by depleting AR and AR-V. Methods: BLAST (NCT04635059) is a single arm, open-label, phase 2 study of PAC (200mg BID) for patients with PC who underwent definitive treatment and developed BCR.

The primary endpoint is six-month PSA progression free survival per PCWG3 criteria. The null hypothesis that the median PSA-progression-free survival is six months will be tested against a one-sided alternative for the six-month PSA-progression-free survival probability exceeding 50%. Secondary endpoints include time to subsequent therapy, safety and toxicity. Exploratory endpoints include effect of PAC on geriatric domains.

       "  'TPS221Background: TALA is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) approved as monotherapy for germline BRCA1/2-mutated HER 2-negative advanced breast cancer. PARPi have demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) with alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes involved directly or indirectly in homologous recombination repair (HRR). Phase 3 study findings (de Bono et\\xa0al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:2091-2102) resulted in the approval of olaparib for mCRPC. ENZA is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor and established therapy for mCSPC. Since PARP activity has been shown to support AR function, PARP inhibition is expected to increase sensitivity to AR-directed therapies. In addition, AR blockade downregulates HRR gene regulation, which has been hypothesized to induce a “BRCAness” phenotype. A phase 2 study of TALA monotherapy (TALAPRO-1) demonstrated robust antitumor activity in men with heavily pretreated, HRR-mutated mCRPC. The Phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial TALAPRO-3 (NCT04821622) herein presented will compare the combination of TALA plus ENZA versus placebo plus ENZA in men with mCSPC with DDR/HRR alterations. Methods: Approximately 550 patients with mCSPC harboring DDR/HRR alterations will be randomized to TALA (0.5 mg once daily) plus ENZA (160 mg once daily) or placebo (once daily) plus ENZA (160 mg once daily). Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years; histological diagnosis of prostate cancer; alterations in 12 DDR/HRR genes known to sensitize to PARPi (ATM, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C); and metastatic disease (no brain metastases). Primary endpoint is rPFS (time to radiographic progression in soft tissue per RECIST 1.1 or in bone per PCWG3 criteria by investigator, or death). Secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety, and patient-reported outcomes. Patient recruitment is planned at approximately 285 sites in 27 countries, including the US and Europe, South America, South Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Clinical trial information: NCT04821622.',\n",

       "  '222Background: Prognostication in localized prostate cancer is reliant on non-specific tools, an issue that leads to the over- and under-treatment of patients. Various tissue-based molecular biomarkers have attempted to fill this unmet need, but most lack prospective randomized trial validation. Herein, we train and validate prognostic biomarkers in localized prostate cancer using five phase III randomized trials, by leveraging multi-modal deep learning on digital histopathology. Methods: Histopathology image data was generated from pre-treatment biopsy slides in five NRG Oncology phase III randomized radiotherapy prostate cancer trials (RTOG 9202, 9408, 9413, 9910, and 0126). The trials were randomly split into training (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. A multi-modal artificial intelligence (MMAI) architecture was developed to take clinicopathologic and image-based (histopathology) data as input and predict binary outcomes. Using this architecture, various models were trained to predict relevant clinical endpoints: biochemical recurrence (BCR), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCaSS), and overall survival (OS). These models were then validated for measures of prognostic discrimination using the time-based area under the curve (AUC) method. Results: Clinicopathologic and histopathology image data was available for 5,654 of 7,957 eligible patients (71.1%), yielding 16.1 TB of data from 16,204 histopathology slides of pretreatment biopsy samples. After training the models, locking them, and evaluating them on the validation cohort, we found that the MMAI prognostic model had superior discrimination compared to the NCCN model (PSA, T-stage, and Gleason score) for 5-year DM (AUC of 0.84 vs 0.73), 5-year BCR (AUC of 0.69 vs 0.58), 10-year PCaSS (AUC of 0.79 vs 0.66), and 10-year OS (AUC of 0.65 vs 0.58). Within each of the individual trials in the validation cohort, the MMAI-model had superior performance compared to NCCN risk groups for all clinical endpoints. Conclusions: This represents the first ever development and validation of prognostic biomarkers in localized prostate cancer using multiple large phase III clinical trials. We have successfully validated that our MMAI-prognostic biomarkers are superior to standard clinical and pathologic variables in identifying future BCR, DM, PCaSS, and OS. This massively scalable technology is feasible and can help personalize the management of prostate cancer patients.

       "  '223Background: The current standard of care for men with intermediate- and high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) is the addition of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Presently, there are no validated predictive biomarkers to guide ADT use or duration in such men. Herein, we train and validate the first predictive biomarker for ADT use in prostate cancer using multiple phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials. Methods: Pre-treatment biopsy slides were digitized from five phase III NRG Oncology randomized trials of men receiving RT with or without ADT. The training set to develop the artificial intelligence (AI)-derived predictive biomarker included NRG/RTOG 9202, 9413, 9910, and 0126, and was trained to predict distant metastasis (DM). A multimodal deep learning architecture was developed to learn from both clinicopathologic and digital imaging histopathology data and identify differential outcomes by treatment type. After the model was locked, an independent biostatistician performed validation on NRG/RTOG 9408, a phase III randomized trial of RT +/- 4 months of ADT. The DM rates were calculated using cumulative incidence functions in biomarker positive and negative groups, and biomarker-treatment interaction was assessed using Fine-Gray regression such that death without DM was treated as a competing event. Results: Clinical and histopathological data was available for 5,654 of 7,957 eligible patients (71.1%). The training cohort included 3,935 patients and had a median follow-up of 13.6 years (IQR [10.2, 17.7]). After the AI-derived predictive ADT classifier was trained, it was validated in NRG/RTOG 9408 (n = 1719, median follow-up 17.6 years, IQR [15.0, 19.7]). In the NRG/RTOG 9408 validation cohort that had digital histopathology data, ADT significantly improved DM (HR 0.62, 95% CI [0.44, 0.87], p = 0.006), consistent with the published trial results. The biomarker-treatment interaction was significant (p-value = 0.0021). In patients with AI-biomarker positive disease (n = 673, 39%), ADT had a greater benefit compared to RT alone (HR 0.33, 95% CI [0.19, 0.57], p < 0.001). In the biomarker negative subgroup (n = 1046, 61%), the addition of ADT did not improve outcomes over RT alone (HR 1.00, 95% CI [0.64, 1.57], p = 0.99). The 15-year DM rate difference between RT versus RT+ADT in the biomarker negative group was 0.3%, vs biomarker positive group 9.4%. Conclusions: We have successfully validated in a phase III randomized trial the first predictive biomarker of ADT benefit with RT in localized intermediate risk prostate cancer using a novel AI-derived digital pathology-based platform. This AI-derived predictive biomarker demonstrates that a majority of patients treated with RT on NRG/RTOG 9408 did not require ADT and could have avoided the associated costs and side effects of this treatment.',\n",

       "  '224Background: High-risk prostate cancer has a significant risk of recurrence when treated with unimodal therapy. The utility of neoadjuvant therapy prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) has yet to be defined. The ACDC-RP study investigated the use of abiraterone acetate (AA) + prednisone (P) + leuprolide (LHRH) with or without cabazitaxel prior to RP in high-risk patients. Methods: This phase II trial randomized patients to Arm A (AA/P + LHRH + cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 with peg-filgrastim 6 cycles) or Arm B (AA/P + LHRH) for 6 months prior to RP. The primary objective was to compare the rate of pathological complete response (CR) or minimal residual disease (MRD) between treatment arms. MRD was defined as ≤5% of prostate volume involved by tumor. We present RP pathological outcomes, safety signals, and early biochemical response data. Results: Out of 78 randomized participants, 70 completed the full course of study treatment and underwent RP. Across both treatment arms, 31 (44%) men achieved either CR or MRD; 5 men had CR (2 in Arm A) and an additional 26 men exhibited MRD (15 in Arm A), p = 1 between Arm A and B. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in biochemical-free survival (BFS) rate between the two treatment groups. Patients who achieved a CR/MRD experienced significantly longer BFS. Conclusions: Study findings indicate significant tumor response with 44% of patients exhibiting CR/MRD, with no significant difference observed between the two treatment arms. Patients who exhibit CR/MRD experienced better BFS rates. Genomic efforts are underway to determine predictors of response.

       "  '225Background: African American (AA) men are known to develop more aggressive forms of prostate cancer at a younger age compared to their Non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. However, few AA men were included in the major randomized trials assessing the efficacy of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) screening. It is thus unknown whether PSA screening may be more beneficial in the AA population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States (US) Veterans Affairs Health System (VA) using the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure. Inclusion criteria were AA or NHW men aged 55-69 diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer between 2004 and 2017. Patients were classified as never screened with PSA prior to diagnosis, screened at least once prior to diagnosis (some screening), or screened in 5 consecutive years prior to diagnosis (annual screening). A lead-time bias adjusted multivariate regression model was implemented to assess the effect of screening on prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM), with covariates including age, comorbidities, BMI, smoking history, marital status and primary care utilization. Results: A total of 45,825 men met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, including 14,294 (31.1%) AA men and 31,151 (68.9%) NHW men. When compared to no screening, any prior PSA screening was associated with improved PCSM for both AA (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 0.64, p < 0.001) and NHW (SHR 0.62, p < 0.001) patients. Annual PSA screening (vs no or some screening) was associated with improved PCSM for AA men (SHR 0.68, p = 0.013) but not NHW men (SHR 0.90, p = 0.240). Other significant predictors of worse PCSM in both AA and NHW men included older age, earlier year of diagnosis, greater comorbidity burden, and cigarette smoking. Conclusions: In a diverse population of US veterans, at least one prior screening PSA was associated with improved PCSM in both AA and NHW patients. Annual PSA screening was associated with reduced PCSM in AA but not NHW men, suggesting that more intensive screening protocols may be beneficial for AA patients.',\n",

       "  '226Background: Prostate Cancer (PC) is the most common form of cancer in men in the United States. In their lifetime, approximately 1 out of every 6 American men will develop PC. The chances of developing PC increase dramatically after age 50 with more than 72% of cases occurring in individuals over 65 years of age. Methods: We have investigated the use of aspartyl (asparaginyl) β-hydroxylase (AABH) as a cancer biomarker. We have developed a sandwich ELISA for its detection. Here this assay was utilized to screen sera from patients with prostate cancer and PSA values in various ranges. Results: AABH levels were assessed in sera from 263 individuals with PC and 73 men over 50 years of age not known to have cancer. The levels of AABH in the two groups were > 3.00 ng/ml and < 3.00 ng/ml, respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test were 97.5% and 96%. AABH and PSA levels were also compared. The AABH values and sensitivities in individuals with PC and PSA values in the ranges < 2 ng/ml, 2-4 ng/ml and > 4 ng/ml were > 3.00 ng/ml, 99% (n = 115); > 3.00 ng/ml, 98% (n = 64) and > 3.00 ng/ml, 95% (n = 114). Conclusions: The present study of AABH indicates that cancer group can be clearly distinguished from normal healthy controls. Moreover, the study indicates that AABH might be used to identify disease in individuals with questionable PSA values. These results support to the establishment of routine screening of serum AABH as a means to detect those who need referral for prostate biopsy. The use of AABH testing may enhance current prostate cancer screening practices by both identifying individuals with low but suspicious PSA values who should be recommended for biopsy and reducing the number of false biopsies indicated by positive PSA tests. Serum AABH levels are significantly elevated in individuals with prostate cancer. Using a cutoff value of 3ng/ml, overall sensitivity of the assay for prostate cancer is 97%. The test has a specificity of 96% in healthy men over 50 years of age. AABH is elevated in prostate cancer tissue but NOT in normal prostate or in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Serum AABH levels are NOT correlate with PSA levels.',\n",

       "  '227Background: The Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score is a validated risk assessment tool for biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk after radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer. The score is calculated using five clinical variables: age, PSA at diagnosis, Gleason score pattern, percentage of positive biopsy cores, and clinical stage by digital rectal exam (DRE). Since its publication in 2005, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have increasingly been used in clinical evaluation but have yet to be integrated into prostate cancer tumor staging rules or risk-stratification models. We incorporated both clinical- and imaging-derived stage into the CAPRA score to assess the association between the base and imaging-adjusted CAPRA model and the outcome of BCR. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent RP for prostate cancer staged ≤T3a on both DRE and imaging (TRUS/MRI) and diagnosed between 2000-2017 at our institution. DRE was treated as a binary variable (T1 vs ≥T2) as was imaging (≤T2 vs T3a). BCR was defined as 2 consecutive PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml starting 8 weeks post-surgery or receipt of salvage treatment. Two CAPRA scores were computed: one with DRE-derived and one with image-based T-stage. Life table estimates were used to evaluate likelihood of BCR-free survival after RP stratified by CAPRA scores. We performed Cox regression to examine the association between clinical CAPRA components and BCR risk and to determine whether stratifying clinical T1, T2, and T3a disease in CAPRA was independently associated with BCR risk on multivariate analysis. Results: Of 1972 patients studied, 103 (5%) had upstaging in CAPRA risk group with imaging-reported clinical stage. Life table estimates were comparable between DRE- and imaging-based CAPRA score with regard to likelihood of BCR-free survival. In separate unadjusted Cox regression models, DRE-based (HR 1.57; 95% CI 1.50-1.64) and imaging-based clinical CAPRA (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.50-1.63) were both independently associated with risk of recurrence after RP and model fit did not differ significantly. On multivariable Cox regression adjusted for CAPRA component variables, clinical stage ≥T2 on DRE (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.54) and T3a on imaging (HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.47-2.19) were independently associated with BCR risk. Conclusions: Both DRE- and imaging-based clinical CAPRA nomograms are associated with risk of BCR after RP for prostate cancer. On multivariable analysis, both modalities of clinical staging are independently associated with CAPRA score on the risk assessment nomogram. Each staging modality offers independent prognostic information, which supports the continued use of DRE-based clinical staging in prostate cancer risk stratification and demonstrates the potential benefit imaging-based clinical stage may add to these models and to tumor staging standards.',\n",

       "  '228Background: Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores can help identify clinically significant prostate cancer and improve patient selection for prostate biopsies. However, the role of PI-RADS scores in patients already diagnosed with prostate cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of PI-RADS scores with prostate cancer upstaging. Upstaging on final pathology is a surrogate for biochemical recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. Methods: All patients from a single high-volume institution who underwent a prostate multiparametric MRI and radical prostatectomy between 2016-2020 were included in this retrospective analysis. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to investigate potential associations with upstaging events, defined by pT3, pT4, or N1 on final pathology. A logistic regression model and receiver operative characteristic curves were constructed for the prediction of upstaging events based on PI-RADS score, prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), and biopsy Gleason grade groups. Results: 294 patients were included in final analysis. Upstaging events occurred in 137 (46.5%) of patients. On univariable analysis, patients who were upstaged on final pathology had significantly higher PI-RADS scores (OR 2.34 95% 1.64 - 3.40, p < 0.001) but similar PSA-D (OR 2.70 95% 0.94 – 8.43, p = 0.188) compared to patients who remained pT1 or pT2 on final pathology. On multivariable analysis, PI-RADS remained independently significantly associated with upstaging, suggesting it is an independent risk predictor for upstaging. Lymph node metastasis only occurred in patients with PI-RADS 4 or 5 lesions (n = 15). Our model using PSA-D, biopsy Gleason grade, and PI-RADS had a predictive AUC of 0.69 for upstaging events, an improvement from 0.59 using biopsy Gleason grade alone. Conclusions: PI-RADS scores are independent predictors for upstaging events and may play an important role in forecasting biochemical recurrence and lymph node metastasis. PI-RADS scores could improve shared decision making and help set expectations with patients. Modern nomograms should be updated to include PI-RADS to predict lymph node metastases and the likelihood of biochemical recurrence more accurately.Gleason Grade Group UpgradedUpstaged to pT3-4Upstaged to pN1No Upgrading or UpstagingOverall (n = 294)7013715127PIRADS ≤ 3 (n = 36)9 (13%)10 (7%)0 (0%)21 (17%)PIRADS > 3 (n = 258)61 (87%)127 (93%)15 (100%)106 (83%)PSA-D ≤ 0.15 (n = 105)15 (21%)40 (29%)4 (27%)58 (46%)PSA-D > 0.15 (n = 189)55 (79%)97 (71%)11 (73%)69 (54%) ',\n",

We have previously described the development of a Luminex based test for aggressive prostate cancer (MiCheck). To facilitate widespread deployment of MiCheck on standard clinical chemistry analysers such as Roche Cobas and Abbott ARCHITECT/Alinity systems, we have performed additional analytical validation and model development using the MiCheck-01 clinical samples. A novel algorithm, termed MiCheck Prostate, was developed to differentiate aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 3+4 or above) from non-aggressive (GS3+3) or no cancer patients. Methods: Serum protein biomarkers were measured in 317 samples from the MiCheck-01 clinical trial using either Luminex Multiplex kits, Abbott ARCHITECT or Beckmann Coulter systems. Logistic regression models were used to select best analytes, then Monte Carlo cross-validation was applied to avoid overfitting. A final model was selected from the cross-validation models with best test specificity at 95% sensitivity. The MiCheck-01 samples were later all measured on a standard Abbott ARCHITECT system using commercial ARCHITECT IVD tests. The best cross-validated model was developed and the results compared to those obtained from the mixed analyte platforms using ROC curve analysis. Results: The MiCheck Prostate algorithm was developed to maximise discrimination between aggressive prostate cancer and no cancer or non-aggressive cancer. The MiCheck Prostate algorithm reports a percentage risk of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. MiCheck Prostate is a logistic regression algorithm that combines three serum protein markers and one clinical factor and was derived using data from the MiCheck-01 trial. The algorithm gave an AUC of 0.82, with a 48% specificity at a 95% sensitivity cutpoint, with a negative predictive value of 94% for GS3+4 and higher cancers. The samples were later re-measured using all ARCHITECT immunoassays. Good correlations of each analyte across different measurement platforms was observed (Pearson’s R > 0.9). The algorithm was revalidated using the new set of analyte values. AUC of 0.82 for the detection of aggressive CaP, and sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 47% were obtained for the best model, showing no statistical difference to the previous best model derived from the mixed platforms. NPV of 94% for GS3+4 or higher cancers was maintained. Conclusions: The MiCheck Prostate test shows high sensitivity, specificity and NPV for the detection of aggressive prostate cancer. It uses analytes widely available on standard clinical chemistry analysers such as Abbott Architect and Roche Cobas, hence is simple to deploy in the laboratory setting. Studies are ongoing to confirm the MiCheck Prostate algorithm performance using additional clinical sample cohorts.',\n",

       "  '230Background: Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening remains a controversial issue. However, most urological guidelines recommend PSA testing through a shared decision-making process with the patient. The rate of PSA screening in men with a history of cancer compared to men with no cancer history is not well known. We aimed to compare PSA testing in men aged 55-69 years with and without a history of cancer (excluding prostate cancer patients). Methods: Utilizing the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) a retrospective cross-sectional study between the years 2015 and 2018 was carried out to analyze and compare PSA testing rates in men aged 55-69 years. Multivariable logistic regression model was implemented do demonstrate potential associations with PSA testing. Results: A total of 13,850 men aged 55-69 years included in the NHIS Survey were analyzed. 1519 (10.9%) men had a history of cancer (non-prostate). On multivariable analysis, men who were previously diagnosed with cancer had a higher rate of PSA testing compared to men with no history of cancer (OR: 1.88, 95% CI 1.39-2.54, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with an increased likelihood of undergoing PSA testing included: age, homosexual orientation, and married men. In contrast, current smokers, American Indians and Alaskan Natives and Asians were less likely to undergo PSA testing. Conclusions: Our data suggest that men aged 55-69 with a history of cancer are more likely to undergo PSA testing than men with no cancer history.P valueCI 95%ORParameter< 0.0011.04-1.081.06Age0.640.82-1.391.065BlackRace (White reference)0.040.24-0.960.48American Indian/ Alaska native0.0150.41-0.90.613Asian0.0321.05-3.021.78HomosexualSexual orientation (heterosexual reference)0.330.5-7.961.99Bisexual< 0.0011.49-2.081.76Marital status (yes vs. No)< 0.0010.47-0.740.59Current everydaySmoking status (Never smoker reference)< 0.0011.39-2.541.88Ever been told you had cancer?

       "  '231Background: A significant proportion of Prostate cancer (PrCa) risk is attributable to heritable risk factors of which only a minority are high risk Mendelian traits. A greater proportion of PrCa is due to the combined effect of multiple low risk variants. There have been approximately 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified that are associated with PrCa risk in Europeans. Although each of these confer a low to moderate risk of PrCa, the cumulative risk (polygenic risk score, PRS) of increasing numbers of these risk alleles may confer a substantial relative risk. In PrCa genetic profiling, using PRS, could be used to target population screening to those at highest risk. BARCODE1 is the first study to prospectively review the use of a genetic profile in PrCa screening in the general population in the UK. Methods: Our study invited healthy males aged 55-69 to participate through their Primary Care physicians. Collection kits were mailed to retrieve saliva samples. Genotyping was carried out after DNA extraction using a study specific assay and the PRS was calculated for each participant using the sum of weighted alleles for 130 risk loci. Prostate MRI and Biopsy were then offered to men in the top 10% of the genetic risk profile. Results: 40,292 men were invited by letter to participate. The uptake was 22%, of whom 91% of men were eligible for inclusion. Following DNA extraction, genotyping, and quality control checks, data were available for 5008 men. 573 participants had PRS in the top 10% and were invited for screening; 180 underwent a prostate MRI, and 100 went on to have a systematic +/- targeted prostate biopsy. There were 42 diagnoses of PrCa (42%). 52% of cancers detected were low-risk and are being managed with Active Surveillance (AS). Conclusions: The early data from BARCODE1 have shown the feasibility of this population-based study, with an overall uptake of 22% and a cancer incidence of 42% of men in the top decile of PRS. We have identified clinically significant PrCa in 48%. The BARCODE1 study results will be important in defining the role of PRS genetic profiling in targeted PrCa population screening.

       "  \"232Background: Pet/CT scans are increasingly used to evaluate prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure following surgery or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. We assessed the language used in report impressions to characterize the reader's confidence for lesions in various anatomic sites. Methods: Between 2015 and 2021, 419 fluciclovine PET/CT scan reports were identified in our institutional outcomes database. Thirteen phrases routinely used in the report impression section by radiologists at least once to characterize a lesion of interest were identified. The phrases were categorized in the following confidence categories: Definitive (positive, negative), Likely (consistent with, most likely, favors, probable), and Unsure (suspicious for, concerning for, non-specific, conspicuous, compatible with, borderline, unknown). The final analysis set included 353 reports where the prescan PSA value was known within the prior 90 days of the scan. Descriptive statistics, stratified by prescan PSA value, were used to characterize this language for the following anatomic regions: bone, regional lymph nodes, prostate fossa, prostate gland/seminal vesicles, other soft tissue. Results: Overall, definitive language was used between 34.6% to 87.1% of the time, depending on the anatomic context (table). The intact prostate was the least likely site to use definitive language (34.6%), whereas bone was most likely (87.1%). Intact prostates in post-radiation patients had the most uncertainty to the persistence of disease (42.3% unsure, 23.1% likely). The highest degree of definitive certainty occurred in impressions of persons with PSA <0.5 (89.2%), whereas the least definitive certainty was in patients with PSA >1 (66.2%). Overall, definitive, likely and unsure findings were reported in 68.6, 9.7%, and 21.7% of scans. Conclusions: Fluciclovine PET/CT scans routinely result in equivocal findings, which vary by anatomic site of interest and prescan PSA level. The language utilized in these reports has not been standardized. Future work aims to create a clear confidence level lexicon standard to assist radiologists and providers in reporting standardization.BoneFossaProstateNodesSoft Tissuen%n%n%n%n%AllDefinitive25787.117281.92734.618261.722877.6Likely124.183.81823.13411.5186.1Unsure268.83014.33342.37926.84816.3Total295100.0210100.078100.0295100.0294100.0PSA<0.5Definitive4293.33890.52100.03373.34088.9Likely12.224.4Unsure24.449.51022.2511.1Total45100.042100.02100.045100.045100.0PSA 0.5-<1Definitive3494.42376.7350.02261.12877.8Likely13.312.812.8Unsure25.6620.0350.01336.1719.4Total36100.030100.06100.036100.036100.0PSA >1Definitive18184.611180.42231.412759.416075.1Likely115.175.11825.73114.5178.0Unsure2210.32014.53042.95626.23616.9Total214100.0138100.070100.0214100.0213100.0 \",\n",

       "  '233Background: The UCSF-CAPRA score is a validated risk tool that uses patient factors at diagnosis to predict prostate cancer outcomes after radical prostatectomy. This study aims to evaluate whether the substitution of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density for serum PSA improves the predictive performance of the clinical CAPRA model. Methods: Participants were diagnosed in 2000-2019 with stage T1/T2 cancer, underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer, and had at least 6 months of post-surgical follow up. We computed the standard CAPRA clinical risk score using diagnostic age, Gleason grade, percentage of positive cores, clinical T stage, and serum PSA, as well as an alternate score based on the same variables but substituting PSA density (incremental categories) for serum PSA. We reported validated CAPRA categories of low (0-2), intermediate (3-5) and high (6-10) risk. Recurrence was defined as 2 consecutive PSA > = 0.2 ng/ml or receipt of salvage treatment. Life table and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy. Two Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test associations of standard or alternate CAPRA component variables with risk of recurrence. Two additional models tested associations between standard CAPRA score or alternate CAPRA score with risk of recurrence. The Cox log-likelihood ratio test (-2 LOG L) was used to assess model accuracy. Results: A total of 2,557 patients had a median age of 61 years (IQR 56-66), GG1 34% and GG2 30%, median PSA 6.3 (IQR 4.8-9.3), and median PSA density 0.19 (IQR 0.13-0.29). Post-surgical follow up was 49 months (IQR 25-86). The alternate CAPRA model was associated with significant shifts in risk scores, with 16% of patients increasing and 6% decreasing (p < 0.01). Recurrence-free survival after RP was 75% at 5 years and 63% at 10 years. Both CAPRA component models were associated with risk of recurrence after RP on Cox regression. Covariate fit statistics showed significantly better fit (low -2 LOG L) for the standard CAPRA model compared to the alternate model (-p < 0.01). Both standard (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.49-1.61) and alternate (HR 1.52; 95%CI 1.46-1.58) CAPRA scores were associated with risk of recurrence, with better fit for the standard model p < 0.01). Conclusions: In a cohort of 2,557 men followed for a median of 49 months after RP, a alternate CAPRA model using PSA was associated with higher risk of BCR, but did not perform better than the standard CAPRA model at predicting BCR. While PSA density is well established as an independent prognostic variable in the pre-diagnostic setting and for sub-stratifying otherwise low-risk disease, it does not appear to improve predictive accuracy of BCR models when applied across the full range of cancer risk.',\n",

       "  '234Background: A full bladder for prostate radiotherapy treatment limits overall dose to the bladder and displaces bowel from high dose regions. There is currently no clear consensus on optimum bladder volume for prostate radiotherapy. Inconsistent bladder volumes can cause dosimetric uncertainty, distress, treatment delay and negative toxicity outcomes for patients. To identify potential ways to improve bladder filling consistency we retrospectively analysed bladder volume variation over the course of patients’ treatment and its relationship to various patient and treatment factors. Methods: We included all patients treated with 60gy in 20 fractions to the prostate only over a 1-year period. Standard fractionation, palliative, post-operative, and whole pelvis treatment regimens were excluded from our study. Patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics were collected retrospectively. We recorded patient reported IPSS scores that were completed pre and post treatment. Daily bladder volumes were recorded from cone beam CT (CBCT) retrospectively for a subset of 34 patients and included in correlative analyses with various treatment and patient factors. Results: 69 men were included in this study with a mean planning CT bladder volume of 272ml (79-574). Patients were divided into large ( > 180ml) and small subgroups (N = 46 vs 23). Smaller bladders resulted in a greater post treatment IPSS score (10.2 vs 7.7 (p = 0.2)) and greater change in IPSS (+3.3 vs +1.4 (p = 0.23). The variation of daily bladder volumes as measured by the standard deviation was positively associated with planning CT volume (p < 0.05), variation in daily treatment time (p < 0.05) and urinary symptoms (p = 0.29). Greater discordances between planning CT time and mean radiotherapy time resulted in a greater average difference between CBCT bladder volume and planning CT volume (p = 0.16). There were no appreciable seasonal or diurnal associations for all recorded bladder volumes. Conclusions: Smaller bladder volumes at planning CT are associated with increased urinary symptoms whereas larger volumes undergo more daily variation. This data suggests an optimal planning bladder volume of 200-400ml to minimise on treatment variation. This is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between variation in daily treatment times and daily bladder variation. Synchronisation of planning CT time with patient treatment time preference will enable patients to better replicate planning CT bladder volumes. This, along with several other areas for improvement highlighted by this study have formed the basis for a prospective single centre pilot study.',\n",

To date, there is no evidence regarding the prognostic value of baseline HRQOL for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) due to localized prostate cancer (PC). The objective of this study was to assess the impact of baseline preoperative HRQOL on survival prognosis for high-risk PC patients following RP. Methods: 1029 patients with high-risk PC according to NCCN risk stratification and prospectively assessed baseline HRQOL prior RP were included. Patients were stratified by the global health status (GHS) domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, good general HRQOL was defined as GHS≥70 based on validated cut-off levels. Subsequently, a propensity score-matched analysis of 636 patients [n=318 (GHS≥70), n=318 (GHS<70)] was conducted. Primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), secondary endpoint was metastasis-free survival (MFS). Multivariate Cox regression models were performed to assess prognostic significance of baseline GHS on survival outcomes. Harrell’s discrimination C-index was applied to calculate the predictive accuracy of the model (p<0.05). Results: Median follow-up was 40mo. Applying matching variables age, PSA, pT stage, Gleason grade, positive surgical margin rate, and lymph node involvement, patients subcohorts were well-balanced. 5-yr-BRFS (61% vs. 28%; p<0.001) and 5-yr-MFS (86% vs. 68%; p=0.003) were significantly increased in the GHS≥70 cohort. In multivariate analysis GHS≥70 was confirmed as an independent predictor for increased BRFS (HR 0.60, 95%CI 0.44–0.82; p=0.013) and MFS (HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.30–0.87; p=0.026). Adding baseline HRQOL to our model improved predictive accuracy of BRFS by 8% (Harrell’s C-index of 0.69 vs 0.65). Conclusions: Our findings highlight baseline HRQOL to be a valuable and robust prognostic factor for patients with localized high-risk PC prior RP. Baseline good general HRQOL accurately predicts increased BRFS and MFS.Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis of biochemical recurrence free survival.ParameterHR95% CIp valueLowerUpperGHS ≥ 700.5970.440.820.001PF scale0.9840.971.010.093pT-stage1.2681.051.530.012Gleason-score1.1981.021.410.029PSA pre-OP1.0261.011.050.008positiv surgical margin1.1740.831.660.362adjuvant radiotherapy0.2680.170.44<0.001Lymph node involvement1.5771.022.480.048 ',\n",

Several factors such as cancer control and quality of life after treatment are considered to be important, but there are few reports comparing sexual function changes before and after treatment between RARP and CIRT. We performed retrospective study comparing the evaluation of sexual function after RARP and CIRT cases using the propensity score matching method. Methods: 127 patients treated by RARP from 2014 to 2018 and 190 patients treated by CIRT monotherapy from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. We evaluated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) score before and after treatment. The EPIC was compared before, 12 months, and 24 months after treatment. Propensity score matching was performed using the age at treatment, PSA value, T stage, and pretreatment EPIC comprehensive score of sexual function as covariates. A cohort of 101 patients in each group was prepared and examined. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gunma University Hospital (No. IRB2020-050, 1839). Results: The mean ± standard deviation of each of the RARP and CIRT groups were age; 65.1 ± 5.9, 65.3 ± 6.5 years, PSA value; 6.31 ± 2.07, 6.34 ± 2.46 ng/ ml, pretreatment EPIC sexual function overall score; 46.4 ± 15.6, 48.2 ± 16.2. In both groups, T1N0M0 was 16%, T2N0M0 was 83%, and T3N0M0 was 1%. The total EPIC sexual function scores before, 12 months, and 24 months after treatment were 46.4, 27.9, 28.2 in the RARP group, and 48.2, 41.4, 41.6 in the CIRT group, respectively. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in score after 12 months and 24 months compared to before treatment (p < 0.05). At 12 and 24 months, the total EPIC sexual function score in the CIRT group was significantly higher than RARP group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In prostate cancer cases adjusted by propensity score matching, the decrease in EPIC sexual function score was significantly smaller in the CIRT group than RARP group.

However, the sampling for inclusion can impact generalizability of findings to other settings. We use a population-based cancer registry to evaluate demographics, cancer factors, and treatment patterns based on eligibility for a facility-based cancer registry. Methods: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer (site = C61.9) in 2018. Exposure was whether data were reported from a facility accredited by American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer (CoC), providing eligibility for the National Cancer Database (NCDB) (i.e., NCDB-eligible). Outcomes of interest included demographics, tumor factors (e.g., biopsy grade), and treatment. Bivariate testing and multivariable regression analyses tested for significant associations between exposure and outcomes of interest. Results: We identified 57,713 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, of which 32,384 (61.9%) were eligible for inclusion in NCDB. NCDB-eligible men were younger (66.6 vs 67.8 years, p < 0.001), less likely to be Hispanic/Latino (8.0% vs 14.4%, p < 0.001), and more likely to reside in a county with median income over $75,000 (39.7% vs 33.3%, p < 0.001). NCDB eligibility varied widely by registry, from 96.1% in Connecticut to 44.7% in Utah. The proportion of localized cancer patients with Grade Group 1 cancer on biopsy was higher among men ineligible for NCDB (41.4% vs 26.9%, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with more advanced disease at presentation was higher among NCDB-eligible patients (metastatic: 9.4% vs 6.8%; regional: 18.7% vs 8.7%; p < 0.001). For patients with localized or regional cancer, treatment was identified more frequently among NCDB-eligible patients for both low-risk (38.5% vs 22.7%, p < 0.001) and high-risk tumors (84.9% vs 64.2%). Among treated patients, use of radical prostatectomy was more common among NCDB-eligible patients (low risk: 58.9% vs 43.1%; high risk: 53.7% vs 43.4%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Prostate cancer patients eligible for inclusion in the facility based NCDB have important differences in demographics, severity of cancer risk, and treatment patterns compared to those who are not eligible. Generalizations related to epidemiologic trends, practice patterns, and outcomes for prostate cancer patients in the NCDB should be interpreted with caution.',\n",

       "  '238Background: In the current era of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), same day discharge (SDD) following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is emerging as the standard of care. In order to implement a safe and efficient SDD pathway, it is imperative to appropriately select candidates and have established discharge criteria. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize published pathways, as well as to evaluate the differences in peri-operative characteristics, complication/readmissions rates, and satisfaction/cost data, between in-patient (IP) RARP versus SDD-RARP. Methods: This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021258848). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, and conference abstract publications was performed comparing outcomes between IP-RARP and SDD-RARP. A leave-one-out sensitivity analyses was performed to control for heterogeneity and risk of bias. Results: A total of 14 studies (eight prospective and six retrospective cohort studies) were included with a pooled population of 3795 patients, including 2348 (61.9%) IP-RARPs and 1447 (38.1%) SDD-RARPs. SDD pathways varied, though many commonalities were present in patient selection (minimal comorbidities and lived close to the hospital [≤ 50-150 km]), peri-operative recommendations (judicious intra-operative intravenous fluids and short-acting narcotics), and post-operative management (immediate ambulation and diet, and non-narcotic analgesia). When compared to IP-RARP, SDD-RARP had no differences in ≥ Grade 3 Clavien–Dindo complications (RR: 0.4, 95% CI 0.2, 1.1, p = 0.07), 90-day readmission rates (RR: 0.6, 95% CI 0.3, 1.1, p = 0.10), or unscheduled ED visits (RR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.3, 3.1, p = 0.97). Cost savings per patient ranged between $367-2109 (USD), and overall satisfaction was high between 87.5-100%. Conclusions: Same day discharge following RARP is both feasible and safe, with comparable complication and readmission rates to IP-RARP. Additionally, SDD offers healthcare cost-savings with high patient satisfaction rates. Data from this study will further inform the uptake and development of future SDD pathways in contemporary urological care such that it may be offered to a broader patient population.',\n",

       "  '239Background: Baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a strong predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer. In a large cohort of patients undergoing opportunistic testing, our objective was to assess the association between first serum PSA in combination with other PSA predictors and risk of prostate cancer. Methods: This was a retrospective, population-based study in Ontario, Canada between 2010-2019. Men 40-75 years of age who underwent incident PSA testing with at least two PSA tests during the study period were included. Among men who underwent PSA testing, the PSA levels of patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer were compared to patients who were not. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to compare any prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer diagnosis (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group 2-5) between groups. Results: A total of 508,238 patients were included in our cohort (12,444 cases and 495,794 controls). The median follow-up time was 8.2 years (IQR: 7.0-9.1). Patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer were older (median age 62 [IQR: 56-67] versus 56 years [IQR:50-63], standardized difference [SD]:0.61) and had a higher first PSA than patients who were not (median 4.79 [IQR:3.29-6.96] versus 0.96 ng/mL [IQR:0.58-1.69], SD:1.93). Fewer than 0.1% (248/261,463) of patients with a first PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the study period. Our final multivariable model revealed that a first PSA above 2.0 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.64, 95%CI: 6.13-7.20, p < 0.001), a final PSA between 4.0 to 9.9 ng/mL and 10.0 to 20.0 ng/mL (adjusted OR 22.09, 95%CI: 20.58-23.71, p < 0.001 and adjusted OR 47.46, 95%CI: 43.28-52.05, p < 0.001, respectively) and change from first to final PSA per 365 days of 20.0 to 99.9% (adjusted OR 3.40, 95%CI: 3.21-3.60, p < 0.001) and more than 100% (adjusted OR 6.91, 95%CI: 6.29-7.59, p < 0.001) were strongly associated with the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The model performed well when predicting any prostate cancer, clinically significant prostate cancer, and when stratified by age. Conclusions: This study suggests that first PSA in combination with final PSA and rate of change can be used to predict prostate cancer diagnosis. Future studies will be conducted to determine the association with metastatic and lethal prostate cancer.',\n",

       "  '240Background: Debate remains about the value of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based prostate cancer screening among men aged 55-69 (USPSTF Grade C). However, no professional society or guideline recommends PSA based prostate cancer screening in men younger than age 40. This study aims to understand the risk of PSA testing exposure in young men, and we hypothesize that substantial low-value testing occurs in this population. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of claims data from the MarketScan database to identify men aged 18 to 39 without prostate cancer who received a PSA test from 2008 to 2017. For the primary analysis, men were required to be continuously in the database for least 5 years. Age groups were stratified to include: men less than 25, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 years. Secondary analysis did not limit subjects to those with 5 years of continuous data and explored the association of Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lower urinary tract symptoms, erectile dysfunction, depression/anxiety, prostate cancer screening, infertility, and hypogonadism with PSA testing in young men. We used logistic regression to determine which of the factors were associated with PSA testing in young men. Results: We identified claims for 40,164,773 adult men who met study criteria. Of these men, 3,230,748 were continuously in the Marketscan database for at least 5 years. The cumulative risk for receiving a PSA over 5 years for men under 40 is 2.5%. Stratified by age, men aged 35-39 are at highest risk (Table). Logistic multivariable regression showed that, relative to all men between 18 and 40, patients in this age group who received a PSA were more likely to be diagnosed with hypogonadism (OR 20.55, 95% CI 20.39-20.71) or lower urinary tract symptoms (OR 9.34, 95% CI 9.26-9.41). Higher CCIs appeared to correlate with a decreased rate of PSA testing. This population was not significantly more likely to be diagnosed with infertility, depression, or anxiety. Conclusions: PSA screening for men under 40 is not uncommon, especially when associated with concomitant genitourinary symptoms. At a population level, this represents substantial low-value testing. Interventions aimed at clarifying the relationship between common urologic conditions and prostate cancer, the extremely low incidence of prostate cancer in this age group, and the lack of guidelines supporting this practice may help decrease low-value PSA testing.

       "  '241Background: Surgery and radiotherapy are standard therapies for patients with early-stage prostate cancer (PrCa). However, studies show that patients with low-risk localized PrCa (Gleason 6; Grade Group (GG) 1 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10) could be safely monitored with active surveillance (AS), if intense patient follow up and re-biopsy schedules are utilized. Here, we reviewed clinical outcomes of AS of a program associated with the Niagara Health System (NHS) PrCa diagnostic program, which provides centralized diagnosis, systematic follow up, re-biopsy and multi-disciplinary consultation clinics for all patients in the Niagara region, Ontario, Canada. Methods: After receiving appropriate ethics approval, NHS databases were searched for patients that underwent more than one biopsy of the prostate in the period Jan. 2015 (program inception) to Dec. 2020. Cases were reviewed for clinical stage, biopsy results and treatment record data. Data were then codified for anonymity and analyzed. Criteria for inclusion into the analysis involved, i) a minimum of two PrCa biopsies before treatment and ii) detailed reporting of biopsy and clinical results (number of positive cores, % of core involvement, and PSA). Results: A total of 343 AS patient cases were identified in the initial search. Of those 52 cases did not meet inclusion criteria. The baseline GG score distribution in the 291 cases included in the analysis was, GG0: 27 (cases with negative biopsies but high PSA), GG1: 247 and GG2: 17 (patients refusing treatment). A total of 144 cases (49.5%) progressed at re-biopsy. Rates of progression to higher GG category in the three groups were 100%, has 46.5% and 50%, respectively. The average time to progression was 23.3+15.5 months. The rate of progression to treatment after entering AS was 39.17% (114/291). Average time from first biopsy to treatment was (28.4+14.5 months). Amongst those that received treatment the overall rate of progression to high-intermediate or high-risk PrCa, was 29.8%, with 20.8% of cases (30/144) progressing to GG>3 (Gleason Score 7: 4+3 or higher) and 9.0% (13/144) progressing to PSA > 20. Of the treated patients, 70 (61.4%) patients received radiotherapy, 42 (36.8%) combined radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy and (31.3%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Conclusions: This retrospective study provides contemporary real-world systematic AS outcomes from a Canadian program with unique features of systematic urological follow up and centralized diagnosis and multi-disciplinary patient assessment. We observe increased rates of disease progression and need for earlier utilization of treatment compared to those reported by other studies. Further analysis examines factors predicting increased risk for disease progression.',\n",

       "  '242Background: Active surveillance (AS) is the standard of care for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). However, there is limited data exploring factors associated with reclassification among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic men enrolled in AS. In this study, we examined factors associated with reclassification among men enrolled in AS within a multiethnic population. Methods: We identified men enrolled in AS from 2005-2019 at our institution, and collected demographic/clinical data. We then compared characteristics among men who experienced pathologic reclassification while on AS vs men who did not. Reclassification was defined as either type 1 (Grade Group (GG) 1 to GG2) or type 2 (GG1 to ≥GG3). Our AS protocol generally consists of biannual prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and prostate biopsy every 1-3 years. Prostate MRI is used to guide decisions on selective basis. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with reclassification. Results: Among 197 men enrolled into an AS protocol within our institution, 133 (67.5%) did not experience reclassification by the end of follow-up while 64 (32.5%) did (Table). Median follow-up time was 12 months (IQR: 7-20), and 2-year overall reclassification-free rates were 59.3% (95% CI: 59.2-59.4). 2-year deferred treatment rates were 26.4% (95% CI: 26.3-26.5) for radical prostatectomy (RP) and 16.9% (95% CI: 16.8-17.0) for radiation therapy (RT). NHB and Hispanic men composed 87 (44.2%) and 70 (35.5%) of our cohort, respectively. Higher PSA at diagnosis was associated with adverse reclassification (OR=1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.05, p=0.002), and there was a trend towards NHB men having higher odds of experiencing reclassification (OR=2.78, 95% CI: 0.85-9.10) although the result was not statistically significant (p=0.09). Conclusions: In a diverse, multiethnic cohort, rates of adverse reclassification on AS were relatively low. The only factor predictive of reclassification while on AS was higher median PSA at diagnosis; however, NHB men did have a trend towards a higher odds of reclassification. Our results suggest that men who are NHB or have higher PSA at diagnosis may benefit from increased surveillance intensity, as they are more likely to experience reclassification while on AS.No Reclassification (N=133)Reclassification (N=64)pUnivariate Model (HR, 95% CI)pAverage age at reclassification or last biopsy (yrs, SD)62.17.564.55.70.031.030.99-1.060.145-ARI Use, N (%)1813.546.30.450.690.25-1.900.47Median Follow-up Time (months, IQR)127.0-19.0128.0-12.00.93Median PSA at diagnosis (ng/mL, IQR)4.71.3-6.763.9-9.00.0031.031.01-1.050.0022-Year RatesRate (%)95% CIOverall Reclassification-Free Survival59.359.2-59.4Type 165.965.8-66.0Type 282.382.2-82.4Deferred RP26.426.3-26.5Deferred RT16.916.8-17.0 ',\n",

       "  '243Background: While intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is commonly used to deliver moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy (MHRT) for prostate cancer (PC), IMRT has not been prospectively compared to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in the context of MHRT. This secondary analysis of the phase III RTOG 0415 trial compares survival outcomes and toxicity across RT technique between IMRT and 3D-CRT for low-risk PC. Methods: The phase III, non-inferiority trial RTOG 0415 randomized patients with low risk PC to either MHRT (70Gy at 2.5Gy/fraction) or conventionally fractionated radiation (CFRT; 73.8Gy at 1.8Gy/fraction) with stratification by RT technique. A secondary analysis for differences in overall (OS), biochemical recurrence free survival (BRFS), or toxicity by EPIC scores and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) was performed. For patient and tumor characteristics, continuous data were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical data with Chi-squared test, as appropriate. Rates of BRFS and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: 1079 patients received the allocated intervention with a median follow up of 5.8 years. RT technique was balanced between treatment arms, with 79.1% of patients receiving IMRT. RT protocol compliance was > 95% for both IMRT and 3D-CRT. There were no significant differences in BRFS between patients treated with 3D-CRT versus IMRT for all patients (p = 0.33), those randomized to CFRT (p = 0.78), or those randomized to MHRT (p = 0.24). Overall survival did not differ by RT technique as well. For all patients, there was no difference in acute and late GI and GU toxicity rates across RT technique. For patients treated with MHRT, late grade 2 GU toxicity was more common with IMRT than 3D-CRT (31.3% vs 23.4%; p = 0.004). On logistic regression analysis, only poor baseline urinary function, defined as an EPIC score of 90 or below, correlated with acute (p < 0.001) or late (p < 0.001) GU toxicity. Baseline bowel function did not correlate to GI toxicity. Conclusions: RT technique did not impact survival outcomes or toxicity rates following MHRT for low risk PC. Higher rates of late CTCAE grade 2+ GU and GI toxicity observed within the RTOG 0415 MHRT arm were not disproportionally observed following 3D-CRT than IMRT. These data highlight the need for careful consideration of target delineation and normal tissue constraints in the selection and delivery of appropriate RT technique.',\n",

       "  '244Background: We aimed to evaluate patient-reported functional outcomes (PRO) following definitive radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer (PCa) in a real-life population-based setting. Methods: The population-based Victorian Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry (PCOR-Vic) captures approximately 90% of all PCa cases in the state. From 2015 onwards, all men in PCOR-Vic were contacted to complete the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short-form 26 (EPIC-26) at 12-month post-treatment. The EPIC-26 included urinary incontinence, urinary obstructive, bowel, sexual and hormonal function domain scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher score representing better outcomes. We estimated differences in the EPIC-26 domain scores between different RT techniques using linear regression, adjusting for patient, tumor, and treatment related factors, including the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The nature of recruitment methods and data collection in PCOR-Vic precluded us from measuring EPIC-26 prior to treatment, and hence this was not adjusted for in our analyses. Results: Between 2015 and 2020, there were 1,898 men treated with definitive RT who completed the EPIC-26 questionnaires and were included in this study – 1551 (82%) had external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone, 91 (5%) had EBRT with brachytherapy boost (EBRT+BT), 204 (11%) had low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) alone, and 52 (3%) had high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) alone. There were 1,140 (60%) men who had ADT with RT – 68% with EBRT alone, 76% with EBRT+BT, 4% with LDR-BT, and 21% with HDR-BT (P < 0.001). Compared to men who had EBRT alone, men who had LDR-BT had higher adjusted mean EPIC-26 urinary incontinence (8.6 points; 95%CI: 5.3-12.0; P < 0.001), sexual (13.5 points; 95%CI: 9.2-17.8; P < 0.001) and hormonal score (6.8 points; 95%CI: 3.5-10.1; P < 0.001) at 12-month post-treatment. Compared to men who had EBRT alone, there were no statistically significant differences in all five EPIC-26 domain scores in men who had EBRT+BT or HDR-BT alone. Conclusions: This is the first Australian real-world evidence on PRO for different RT modalities for PCa on a population-based level. We observed better urinary incontinence, sexual and hormonal function in men who had LDR-BT compared to EBRT, but no significant differences between men who had EBRT, EBRT+BT or HDR-BT.',\n",

       "  '245Background: SBRT for localized prostate cancer (PCa) is the focus of several ongoing and reported high-impact trials, which often focus on physician-reported toxicity (P-Tox) when comparing regimens. Patient-reported quality of life (PR-QoL) may differ and provide a more sensitive comparative metric of treatment burden, especially with fewer provider interactions during SBRT than during protracted RT courses. We evaluated the concordance of prospective genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) P-Tox and PR-QOL in men receiving SBRT for PCa. Methods: Data from two concurrently-enrolled prospective trials of SBRT in high-risk (Phase I Safety Endpoint, NCT01896271) and low-intermediate risk (Phase II GI Toxicity Endpoint, NCT02353832) PCa were used. Matching standardized schedules of collected PR-QoL [Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)] and P-Tox (CTCAE v5.0) were analyzed over the first 18 months of follow up, where symptoms are most pronounced. We assessed concordance of Grade≥2 GU/GI physician reported toxicity with PR-QoL declines exceeding anchor based minimal clinically important difference (MCID) thresholds (-6 urinary and -5 bowel summary scores, respectively) for each patient at each time point. Patients without baseline PR-QoL data were excluded in full, while time points with missing PR-QoL or P-Tox were excluded individually without imputation. Concordance was evaluated by Cohen’s kappa statistic. Results: From 101 patients, there were 256 (64%) follow up observations through 18 months with both PR-QoL and P-Tox at the time point and baseline. Concordance of PR-QoL and P-Tox was low at all time points for both GU and GI toxicity domains (mean kappa 0.093; Table). MCID was more often reported by patients than Grade≥2 toxicity by physicians (38% vs 17% for GU and 44% vs 10% for GI). There was little overlap of PR-QoL and P-Tox reporting: Grade≥2 P-Tox reported in 17% of observations with MCID in PR-QoL, while MCID in PR-QoL reported in 54% of observations of Grade ≥2 P-Tox. Mean concordance was similarly low when analyzing sub-groups of trial, investigator, and an alternative 2xMCID threshold. Conclusions: P-Tox and PR-QoL differed dramatically in two prospective studies of SBRT despite toxicity primary endpoints. This may reflect subjective and varying intervention thresholds driving P-Tox reporting, rather than actual patient burden. These data strongly support use of PR-QoL rather than P-Tox for SBRT comparative study endpoints and guidelines in this rapidly evolving space.

       "  '246Background: The late, persistent, substantial treatment-related symptoms (LAPERS) is a novel methodological approach to identify clinically relevant and long-lasting symptoms after treatment. It was first reported in a cohort of women with cervical cancer in the EMBRACE study. We applied the LAPERS methodology to report long-term outcomes following low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDRBT) for prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: We studied a cohort of men with PCa treated with LDRBT in a single Australian institution, who completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite short-from 26 (EPIC26) questionnaire before LDRBT, and at regular intervals after LDRBT. For LAPERS analyses, 1) we limited the analyses to men with baseline EPIC26, and at least 3 ‘late’ follow-up EPIC26 (from 6 months post-LDRBT onwards); 2) ‘substantial’ symptoms were defined as either ‘moderate’ (score 25) or ‘big problem’ (score 0) in EPIC26 urinary and bowel domain questions which assess the degree of symptom bother; 3) ‘persistent’ symptoms were defined as ‘substantial’ symptoms that present in at least half of the ‘late’ follow-up EPIC-26 assessments. This provides a binary (yes/no) LAPERS outcome. We estimated cumulative incidence of substantial symptom with the Kaplan-Meier methods. We reported on 1) proportion of men with LAPERS, 2) proportion with baseline-corrected LAPERS, 3) prevalence of substantial symptoms at specified timepoint, and 4) cumulative incidence of substantial symptoms. Results: 177 men were included in the study. The median follow-up was 60 months (IQR: 36-74 months). For overall urinary function, the proportion of men with LAPERS was 2.3% (baseline corrected LAPERS 2.3%). The prevalence of substantial urinary symptoms at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months were 5.9%, 4.4%, 2.9%, 0.7%, 1.8%, and 5-year cumulative incidence was 17.8% (95%CI = 12.7-24.6%). For overall bowel function, the proportion of men with LAPERS was 2.3% (baseline-corrected LAPERS 1.7%). The prevalence of substantial bowel symptoms at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 months were 7.6%, 3.0%, 3.6%, 3.6% and 2.2%, and 5-year cumulative incidence was 16.2% (95%CI = 11.3-23.2%). Conclusions: We observed considerable differences between LAPERS, prevalence and cumulative incidence of substantial symptoms in men with PCa treated with LDRBT. Cumulative incidence (‘time-to-first event’ analyses) may overestimate the burden of late toxicities as considerable proportion of patients do not experience persistent symptoms over time, and LAPERS is more reflective of ‘true’ late toxicities, taking into account the duration of symptoms.',\n",

       "  '247Background: Dose escalation in prostate cancer (PCa) radiotherapy (RT) is limited by toxicity to surrounding tissue, including the rectum. Rectal spacers improve bowel toxicity in men treated with photons (i.e. IMRT). However, the relative benefit of rectal spacers in men treated with protons remains unknown. Further, proton therapy may result in high-dose exposure to the anterior rectal wall due to lateral penumbra with conventional opposed lateral beam arrangement. We hypothesize that rectal spacers will confer greater toxicity benefit in the setting of proton therapy compared with photon therapy. Methods: We conducted an IRB approved, single institution, retrospective review of patients receiving definitive conventional or moderate hypofractionated photon IMRT or pencil-beam scanning proton RT for localized PCa from 2018-2021. Four cohorts were compared: Photon with (Ph+RS) or without (Ph-RS) rectal spacer, and proton with (Pr+RS) or without (Pr-RS) rectal spacer. Rates of pelvic nodal treatment were equivalent between protons and photons within the +/- rectal spacer cohorts. Acute (<3 months) and late (≥ 3 month) toxicity was compared amongst the four cohorts. Cumulative incidence of physician-reported grade 1-2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (CTCAE V5.0) was compared using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Patient-reported bowel toxicity was evaluated using International Prostate Expanded Prostate Composite Index- Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) and compared using linear mixed modeling. Results: 164 patients were eligible for analysis: 38 Ph-RS, 50 Ph+RS, 26 Pr-RS, & 50 Pr+RS. Median follow-up was 17.6 months. In men treated with protons, physician-reported acute G1-2 GI toxicity was significantly lower in men with versus without rectal spacer (6.12 vs 30.77%, Pr+RS vs Pr-RS, respectively; p=0.009) and there was a trend towards lower late G1-2 GI toxicity (8.51 vs 26.09%, Pr+RS vs Pr-RS, respectively; p=0.08). In men treated with photons, there were no significant differences in physician-reported acute or later GI toxicity with versus without rectal spacer. No significant differences in patient-reported outcomes were observed with versus without spacer in the proton or photon cohorts. Conclusions: Rectal spacer use was associated with a lower CTCAE grade 1-2 acute GI toxicity in men treated with protons, and this difference was not observed in men treated with photons. While this study is limited by low sample size, a relatively greater benefit of rectal spacer with proton vs. photon therapy was observed. Further prospective analyses in larger cohorts are ongoing to validate these hypothesis-generating findings.',\n",

       "  '248Background: Hypofractionated prostate cancer radiation has showed similar results in several prior phase III studies (PCG GU 003, PACE-B, and Hypo PC RT). However, prospective phase II-III clinical trial data testing 5 tx after prostatectomy is scarce. Methods: Between 2018 and 2019, 41 patients were treated after postprostatectomy for high risk features. 5 patients were treated adjuvantly, 36 for salvage including 8 with oligometastatic disease. Indications for adjuvant RT included a PSA < 0.2 and +margins, SVI, or EPE. Salvage RT was offered for PSA ≥0.2. Oligometastatic RT for patients with ≤5 RT targets. Staging included C11 PET for all cases. Total dose to the prostate bed was 30-32 Gy in 5tx QOD with IMRT, conebeam IGRT, and MRI registration. All salvage patients received ADT for 6 months and oligometastatic patients for 18 months. Dose to the metastatic sites was 30 in 5tx QOD. Of the 41 patients 8 also received SBRT to the sites of oligometastatic disease. We looked at clinical outcomes defining biochemical failure as a PSA > 0.2 after treatment, baseline adjusted CTC AE V5.0, baseline adjusted patient reported toxicities (PRO CTC AE), QOL (EPIC, PROMIS), and AUA was used for all cases. Results: Median follow up was 23 months (range 10-37). Pre-RT T stage was T2-T3b, with 47% being T3a-b; Pre RT Median PSA of 0.4 (range < 0.1-1.9); Median GS 8 (6-9); and (+) margins in 48.8%. Sites of oligometastatic disease radiated included the LN and bone. Treatment related AE were grade 0-1 in all cases, except for one patient with G2 GU incontinence. Overall QOL remained high during follow including Promis 10 overall, mental, and physical scores; urinary bother, irritative/obstructive, and AUA scores; bowel overall, bowel bother, and bowel function scores; and overall sexual, sexual function, and sexual bother scores remained at baseline levels during follow up. Only hormonal overall, hormonal function, and hormonal bother had lower scores at 3 months that recovered by 12 months in patients treated with ADT for 6 months and by 24 months in patients treated with ADT for 18 months. A total of 3 clinical failure have been seen; 2 patients with regional failures alone; and one with axial skeleton bony failures for 93% clinical control at median follow up of 23 months. All 3 patients with clinical failure were salvaged successfully with SBRT and all patients remain disease free at last follow up. A total 5 patients with raising PSAs alone have been seen. All patients have been re-staged with C11 PET. No failures in the prostate bed or previously radiated sites have been seen. Conclusions: Toxicity for RT over 5tx is lower than expected with only one case of grade 2 urinary incontinence. QOL scores remained high during follow up, minor changes in hormonal scores were seen during ADT, but recovered after. 30-32 Gy over 5 tx provided 100% control in radiated targets and metastatic sites.

       "  '249Background: Immunotherapy could potentially prevent disease progression for early-stage prostate cancer. In this randomized Phase 2 clinical trial, we evaluated the clinical effects of PROSTVAC, a vaccinia/fowlpox viral vector-based immunotherapy that contains PSA and three T-cell costimulatory molecules, in patients with localized prostate cancer. Methods:154 patients with clinically localized, low- or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer active surveillance were randomized (2:1) to receive 7 doses of subcutaneous PROSTVAC or placebo (empty fowlpox vector) over 140 days. Post-intervention prostate biopsy was performed 7-14 days after the last dose. Participants were followed for 6 months post-treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline to post-vaccination in CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration in biopsy tumor tissue. Secondary outcomes included changes in prostate biopsy Gleason grade (Grade Group) and serum PSA. Results: There were no differences in CD4 and CD8 densities (count of cells/mm2) in post-treatment biopsy tumor tissue between groups (p = 0.63 and p = 0.75, respectively). Compared to placebo, patients who received PROSTVAC were less likely to demonstrate upgrading at follow-up biopsy, but this difference did not attain significance (22% vs. 40%, p= 0.08). There was no difference in the change of PSA from baseline to 6 months post-treatment between arms (p= 0.30). Conclusions: In this first-of-kind trial of immunotherapy for localized prostate cancer, PROSTVAC was well tolerated but did not elicit significant prostate tissue T-cell responses compared to placebo. The favorable post-treatment biopsy grade findings in PROSTVAC patients merit further evaluation and longer-term clinical follow-up. Clinical trial information: NCT02326805.',\n",

       "  '250Background: Trigger for definitive treatment in active surveillance (AS) is strictly criteria-based, but some patients might be surgically treated without adherence to the criteria. We aimed to evaluate whether oncological outcomes differ depending on adherence to the criteria in patients who opting for AS. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of 1,035 patients enrolled in a prospective cohort of PRIAS-JAPAN. Of 162 patients underwent radical prostatectomy, 136 patients were analyzed, excluding those with Gleason score 3+4 at diagnosis, RP within one year of enrollment. Triggers for RP due to pathological reclassification on repeat biopsy was defined as on-criteria. We compared pathological findings on RP and prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival of on-criteria with off-criteria. Results: Off-criteria was 35 patients (24.7%). There were significant differences in the median time to RP (16 vs. 18.5 months, p<0.001) and median PSA before RP (6.1 vs. 8.3 ng/mL, p=0.007) when comparing patients with on-criteria and off-criteria. Fifty percent of off-criteria received RP within 35 months. On pathological findings of RP, pathological T3≤ (10.5 vs. 9.4%, p=0.183), Gleason score 4+3≤ (33 vs. 28.6%, p=0.679), and pathological N positive (4.3 vs. 0%, p>0.999) were not significantly different. At a median postoperative follow-up of 36 months, no significant difference in PSA recurrence-free survival was found (log-rank p = 0.828). Conclusions: Although half of off-criteria patients underwent RP within 3 years of starting AS, their oncological outcomes were not different from on-criteria.

       "  '251Background: For prostate cancer (Pca), salvage radiotherapy (sRT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is currently the only curative treatment option in case of post-radical prostatectomy (RP) biochemical relapse (BR). Functional imaging techniques have shown that macroscopic recurrence (MR) in the prostate bed (PB) are frequent. In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety of sRT in patients with MR inside the PB proven by functional imaging. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 16 European centers. Patients were included if they displayed BR after RP for Pca, with MR only in the PB proven by functional imaging. All patients had to be eligible for sRT. The overall population was divided along 4 groups according to the delivered treatment: dose escalation on MR (A), dose escalation on PB (B), double dose escalation MR+PB (C), no dose escalation (D). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included the metastasis-free survival (MFS), biochemical PFS (bPFS) and overall survival (OS). Grade ≥2 genito-urinary (GU) and gastro-intestinal (GI) acute and late toxicities were collected. Results: Between January 2000 and December 2019, 363 patients with isolated MR after RP for Pca were treated by sRT. The median pre-sRT PSA level was 0.63ng/mL (range, 0.2-23.6). At the time of BR, 266 (73%) patients presented MR in the PB proven by magnetic resonance imaging, and 110 (30%) by positron emission tomography. The median follow-up was 53.6 months (range, 47.52; 58.32). The 5-year PFS and MFS were 70% (95%CI [63.8-75.4]) and 83.7% (95%CI [78.4-87.8]), respectively. Grade ≥2 GU and GI late toxicities were found in 43 (12%) and 11 (3%) patients, respectively. A 5-year PFS benefit was highlighted for groups A, B and C (313 patients) when the MR dose was ≥72Gy: 72,8% (95%CI 64.6-79.4) versus 60.3% (95%CI 48,4-70,3), p = 0.03. Conclusions: In a modern series integrating functional imaging data, we confirmed that sRT is effective in the event of MR inside the PB, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Prospective data should further investigate the correlation between MR-targeted dose escalation and PFS.',\n",

       "  '252Background: The management of patients with mCRPC has evolved since the introduction of androgen-receptor axis targeted agents (ARATs). The Genitourinary Research Consortium (GURC) initiated a prospective, phase 4, multicentre, non-interventional, longitudinal cohort study of Canadian men with advanced prostate cancer to determine real-world treatment patterns and outcomes. Methods: 25 sites across Canada participated in this study including patients managed by urologists, medical- and radiation-oncologists between 2018 to 2021. Baseline patient characteristics and mCRPC treatment patterns are reported here. Treatment patterns reviewed included time to second-line treatment use and time to progression or death. Results: 136 mCRPC patients were enrolled. Median age was 73 years (range 66 to 80) with 54 (40%) having a Gleason score of >8 at diagnosis. Median PSA at enrollment was 8.9 (2.4 to 25.1) ng/ml. At study entry, 90/132 (66%) patients with mCSPC and 42/132 (31%) patients nmCRPC had progressed to develop mCRPC. One hundred and twenty-one (89%) of patients in this cohort received first-line treatment for mCRPC, the most common was abiraterone acetate + prednisone in 67 (49%) and enzalutamide in 41 (30%), followed by docetaxel in 6 (4.4%), and Radium-223 in 5 (3.7%) patients. During the 25-month median follow-up period (range 6-28), 59 (49%) of the patients receiving first line mCRPC therapy had documented disease progression or death. At the time of last recorded follow-up, 37 (28%) patients who progressed received a second-line therapy for mCRPC. Median time to progression in this cohort was 21 months (95% CI: 15.2 - NE), with ARAT-to-ARAT being the most common sequencing pattern observed in 15 (39%) patients, followed by ARAT to chemotherapy in 14 (37%). Conclusions: In this real-world analysis of mCRPC patients, ARAT therapy was the preferred approach for first-line treatment intensification in over 108 (80%) patients. Despite evidence of poor response rates, ARAT-to-ARAT was the most common sequencing for second line therapy, followed by ARAT-to-chemotherapy treatment. Further analysis and follow-up will help define optimal mCRPC management, in real world setting.']]"

Primary results from this single-arm, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study evaluating TIS in pts with MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors, showed a clinically meaningful improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) for this patient population. Here we report results from the updated analysis (NCT03736889). Methods: Eligible adult pts with previously treated, locally advanced, unresectable/metastatic histologically confirmed MSI-H/dMMR solid tumors with ≥1 measurable lesion (RECIST v1.1) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤1 were enrolled. Pts received TIS 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. The efficacy analysis set were all pts who received any dose of TIS with measurable disease per independent review committee (IRC) at baseline. The primary endpoint was IRC-assessed ORR (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), time to response (TTR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) (all IRC-assessed [RECIST v1.1]), overall survival (OS), and safety. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana SP263) was applied retrospectively. Results: Between Sep 2018–Jul 2021, 80 pts were enrolled (median age 53 years; range 19–81 years) and 75 were included in the efficacy analysis set. In this updated efficacy analysis set, at a median follow-up of 15.2 months, ORRIRC was 46.7% (n = 35; 95% CI 35.1, 58.6) in all tumor types (1-sided p < 0.0001), including 5 complete responses (CR) and 30 partial responses (PR). ORRIRC was 39.1% (n = 18; 95% CI 25.1, 54.6) in colorectal cancer (CRC) pts (N = 46), 55.6% (n = 5; 95% CI 21.2, 86.3) in G/GEJC pts (N = 9), and 60.0% (n = 12; 95% CI 36.1, 80.9) in other pts (N = 20). Of the pts who responded (n = 35), one patient had disease progression. Median DoR was not reached, median TTRIRC was 11.9 weeks (range 8.4–98.9) and DCR was 72.0% (95% CI 60.4, 81.8). Median PFSIRC was not reached (95% CI 7.5, not estimable [NE]). Median OS (safety analysis set) was not reached (95% CI 28.7, NE). No clear association was observed between PD-L1 expression and clinical efficacy. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) ≥Grade 3 occurred in 48.8% (n = 39) of pts. The most common ≥Grade 3 TEAE was anemia, 10.0% (n = 8). Immune-mediated TEAEs ≥Grade 3 were 8.8% (n = 7). Conclusions: With a longer follow up time, TIS demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in ORR in pts with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors. TIS was generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals. These data support TIS as a new treatment option for this patient population. Clinical trial information: NCT03736889.',\n",

       "  '2Background: Anal Cancer incidence and deaths from the disease have been rising in the United States for the past two decades. Data published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (11/19/2019) indicate from 2001 to 2015, anal cancer overall incidence increased by 2.7% per year and deaths rose by 3.1 % each year. This data indicates that anal cancer may be one of the fastest growing causes of cancer incidence and mortality. Now, especially with data indicating the rise in incidence rate, it is imperative that the anal cancer patient lived experience be better understood, including gaps in awareness and prevention education that may lead to earlier diagnosis. The Raymond Foundation in partnership with the anal cancer patient community is amplifying the patient voice by facilitating a series of impactful roundtable conversations to underscore the patient lived experience. Methods: From March–August 2021, the Raymond Foundation convened virtual roundtable conversations and individual interviews with 171 anal cancer patients and survivors. Overarching themes from our conversations included: Barriers to earlier diagnosis and awareness, Frustration and anger by the lack of new treatment protocols, Quality of life after diagnosis, including daily distress levels leading to allostatic load. Results: 94% of patients/survivors reported lack of anal cancer awareness and prevention education that may have led to a later stage diagnosis; 93% reported feeling stigmatized with a marked decrease in quality of life post diagnosis; 90% reported feeling embarrassed when discussing their diagnosis with family and friends; 86% reported frustration and anger by the lack of new treatment options; Anxiety (81%), Fear (78%) Depression (73%) were common daily distress concerns; Reported physical effects of the disease and treatment, include Radiation Proctitis (71%) Fecal Incontinence (68%) Urinary Incontinence (65%). Less than half (44%) of patients felt empowered and comfortable advocating for themselves regarding their healthcare and treatment decisions. Conclusions: Anal cancer patients have many unmet needs–both physical and psycho-social. Their voices and lived experiences provide a roadmap to better understand these unmet needs. Based on our patient-reported outcomes research, we will continue our outreach and partnership with the anal cancer community to provide patient support, education and awareness programs and campaigns that help meet the needs of the anal cancer patient community.',\n",

Given the lack of randomized data of 1 vs 2 doses of MMC on disease outcomes, we have conducted a population-based study to elucidate the impact of 1 vs. 2 doses of MMC on patterns of treatment failure (POF) and outcomes in ACC treatment.

Methods: Data was collected from the provincial cancer registry of patients with stage I-III ACC who were treated with concurrent CRT from 2000 to 2018. Recurrence free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and ACC specific survival were calculated. Results: 428 patients with a median age of 58 years (29-88 years) were included in this analysis. 234 (54.7%) patients received 1 dose of MMC and 194 (45.3%) received 2 doses of MMC. At a median follow-up of 78.5 months (5-252 months), 89 (20.8%) patients developed disease recurrence: 44 (10.3%) loco-regionally, 39 (9.1%) distally and 6 (1.4%) had both local and distant recurrences. Cox Regression analysis showed that the dosage of MMC did not have an impact on overall recurrence (HR = 0.883, p = 0.561), whereas stage III was associated with increased risk for recurrence (HR = 5.238, p = 0.021). Subgroup analysis showed an association of stage IIIb and IIIc with recurrence (HR = 13.33, p = 0.008 and HR = 6.933, p = 0.011 respectively), but was not impacted by the use of 1 vs. 2 doses of MMC. The dosage of MMC did not show any association with local recurrence (HR = 1.136, p = 0.655) or distant recurrence (HR = 0.743, p = 0.267). However, in Stage IIIc patients, 2 doses of MMC showed a trend towards improved distant RFS (HR = 0.626,p = 0.084). Conclusions: Our analysis showed that the patterns of failure and the risk of loco-regional and distant failures were similar between patients who received 1 vs. 2 doses of MMC for stage groups I to IIIc. These finding support routine use of single dose of MMC along with 5FU and radiotherapy for definite chemoradiation. However, a trend towards better RFS was demonstrated with a second dose of MMC in patients with stage IIIc disease.',\n",

       "  '4Background: About 10-20% of patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) present with metastatic disease, and are usually treated with systemic chemotherapy. The role of local therapy to control the primary tumor is controversial in this setting. We evaluated survival impact of local therapy in metastatic anal SCCa. Methods: Data were obtained from all US hospitals that contributed to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 2004 and 2015. We excluded patients who did not receive palliative systemic chemotherapy. Univariate (UVA) and multivariable analyses (MVA) were performed to identify factors associated with patient outcome. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between tumor/patient characteristics and overall survival (OS). Results: 1,160 patients were identified over 12 years. Median age was 57 years. Majority were female (64.9%), non-Hispanic Whites (79.1%) and had Charlson-Deyo Score of 0 (83.6%). Most common metastatic sites were liver (25.9%), lung (11.6%) and bone (8.5%). More than 79% of the patients received radiation to the primary site, and 10.4% underwent surgical resection for local control. Use of local therapy correlated closely with a significant improvement in OS on MVA (HR 0.66; 0.55-0.79; p < 0.001), with a 12-month and 5-year OS rates of 72.8% and 25.7% respectively, compared with 61.1% and 14.6% for patients treated with chemotherapy only. Poor prognostic factors included male gender (HR 1.44; 1.24-1.67; p < 0.001), age > 70 years (HR 1.28; 1.02-1.62; p = 0.034), lack of health insurance (HR 1.32; 1.02-1.71; p = 0.034), and cloacogenic zone location (HR 4.02; 1.43-11.30; p = 0.008). There was no benefit from abdominoperineal resection (mOS = 19.7mos; HR 1.05; 0.48-2.29; p = 0.909), but both local resection of the primary (mOS = 24.8mos, HR 0.48; 0.29-0.80; p = 0.005) and palliative radiation (mOS = 22.6 mos; HR 0.66; 0.55-0.79; p < 0.001) were associated with improved OS. Conclusions: This is the largest reported study on management of de novo stage IV SCCa. The data suggest that local control of the primary tumor through resection or radiation improved OS in patients with anal SCCa. Patients unlikely to benefit from local therapy include age over 70 years, male, lack of health insurance and cloacogenic carcinoma.',\n",

       "  '5Background: Advanced squamous cell anal cancer (aSCAC) is a rare and aggressive disease, accounting for poor prognosis and high morbidity. No targeted therapies are currently available and, after the first line, no standard treatments are approved. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) showed signs of activity in previous phase I/II trials, but predictive and prognostic biomarkers are lacking. Anti-EGFR have been tested given the rarity of KRAS mutations in aSCAC, with encouraging results. Earlier preclinical evidence suggests possible synergism between cetuximab (cet) and ICI. Methods: In the phase II randomized trial CARACAS (NCT03944252), we tested avelumab (ave) alone (Arm A) or with cet (Arm B) in pretreated aSCAC; overall response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint. With one-sided a error set at 0.05 and power of 80%, at least 4 responses out of 27 patients (pts) per arm had to be observed to declare the study positive. On pre-treatment tumor tissue samples, we assessed HPV status, PD-L1 expression, microsatellite status, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and performed next generation sequencing (NGS) via FoundationOne CDx. Primary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes of ICI in SCAC in the CARACAS trial population according to molecular analyses. Secondary objectives were to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) according to molecular characteristics to individuate new prognostic biomarkers in SCAC. Cox regression was used to investigate the effect of the main variables analysed on survival. Translational analyses were performed on the 100% of the study population since all the pts received ICI. Results: In the clinical trial, the Arm B reached the primary endpoint (ORR 17%, 95% CI 5·6-34·7). High TMB (≥10 mutations per megabase) was related with longer OS (HR=0.09; 95% CI 0.01-0.68; p=0.019), showing the same trend in PFS (HR=0.44; 95%CI=0.15-1.27; p=0.129). As well, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 (>40 measured with combined positive score, CPS) showed significantly longer OS (HR=2.19; 95% CI=0.92-5.19; p=0.075) and PFS (HR=2.35; 95%CI=1.09-5.1; p=0.03). High TILs (>1.2) did not affect significantly OS (HR=0.77; 95% CI=0.42-1.4; p=0.39) nor PFS (HR=1.19; 95%CI=0.57-2.48; p=0.645). When combined together and with high TILs, high TMB and PD-L1identified pts with significantly better prognosis in OS (HR=0.43; 95% CI=0.21-0.87; p=0.019) and PFS (HR=0.48; 95%CI=0.23-1.00; p=0.051). Remarkable responses were also observed in pts with high PD-L1 expression and TMB. Conclusions: TranslaCARACAS study documented prognostic role of high TMB and PD-L1 in mSCAC treated with ICI with or without anti-EGFR. Stratifying per high TMB, PD-L1 and TILs, a subgroup of pts with particularly favorable prognosis and deep responses were detected. Further investigation in larger cohorts is warranted to confirm our findings.',\n",

       "  '6Background: For patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC), the current standard of care involves curative-intent definitive chemoradiation. For those that recur locally, salvage surgery maybe a consideration. ASCC, however, still lacks a non-invasive blood-based biomarker, which can be of value in this patient population for monitoring recurrence and/or response to immunotherapy later. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising non-invasive tool to assess molecular residual disease (MRD) and recurrence in ASCC. Here, we evaluated real-world utility of ctDNA status to identify MRD and recurrence in ASCC patients across all stages. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with any stage ASCC receiving SOC or/and immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. A personalized tumor-informed PCR/NGS-based assay (Signatera) was used for ctDNA detection, in the pre/on/post-treatment and surveillance setting. Results: In this study, plasma samples (n=105) were collected from 25 ASCC patients (13 females, 12 males; median age 66 years) at various timepoints for a median follow-up of 315 days (range: 59-1717), post-diagnosis; 12 patients were HPV-positive, 1 patient was HPV-negative, and 12 had unknown HPV status; 88% (22/25) of the patients had serial timepoints (≥2) available. ctDNA-positivity rates, test results, and ctDNA quantification by stage are summarized in Table. The quantitated ctDNA values (mean tumor molecules (MTM)/mL) increased in concordance with the stage of the disease, with values trending higher in stage III and IV. In addition, complete clinical outcome information was available for 22/25 patients at the time of releasing this data. Of the 96 plasma samples drawn from these patients, 68 (70%) were in the surveillance setting (post-definitive therapy). No recurrences were observed among 15 patients who cleared ctDNA on treatment and/or tested negative post-treatment, whereas, 6/7 ctDNA-positive patients were confirmed to have disease recurrence and 1 was pending confirmatory imaging. This often predated recurrence on scans. Conclusions: Measuring and monitoring MRD in patients with ASCC is feasible and has the potential to impact clinical decision making. Our study is the first to set the benchmark for the feasibility of using a tumor-informed assay in ASCC. Larger prospective studies are needed to explore the clinical utility of ctDNA status to guide disease surveillance and management of ASCC.StagePositivity Rate, n/N (%)(patient)ctDNA Results(plasma)Quantity of ctDNA (MTM/mL)NegativePositiveMeanMedianRangeI/II3/6 (50)23111.831.580.05-1.83III4/13 (30.8)431218.772.790.2-67.75IV5/6 (83.3)79129.2728.330.12-556.07 ',\n",

       "  'TPS7Background: Even though the recurrence rate remains high, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) alone is the standard treatment in locally advanced squamous cell anal carcinoma (SCAC), in the absence of effective neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment. Modified docetaxel, cisplatin and 5FU (mDCF) is one of the standard regimens in metastatic SCAC, and induced a radiological complete response (cCR) in 45% of patients, with a biological CR (the conversion from positive to negative HPV ctDNA by liquid biopsy) in 61% of patients. Among chemotherapy-naïve patients, the cCR was as high as 55%, with 90% of ORR and 100% of disease control rate during the first 4 months. Moreover, mDCF was associated with a decrease in Myeloid-Derived Suppressive Cells (MDSC) and an increase in the antitumor anti-hTERT immunity, two major factors correlated with prognosis in advanced SCAC, rendering mDCF a good partner to combine with immunotherapy. Anti-PD1 immunotherapy is effective in chemorefractory SCAC. In sensitive tumors, neoadjuvant anti-PD1, with or without chemotherapy, induced a high rate (30-45%) of complete or near-complete pathological response. The combination of mDCF and immunotherapy is safe. Methods: INTERACTION is an open-label, pivotal, single arm, phase II study in neoadjuvant setting for stage 3 SCAC patients (NCT04719988). Fifty-five patients will receive up to 6 cycles of mDCF (docetaxel 40 mg/m2 and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 on day 1, 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 over 46 h) every 2 weeks, in association with ezabenlimab (anti-PD1 mAb) at 240 mg every 3 weeks. CT-scan, MRI, tumor and liquid biopsies will be performed before treatment, and after 4 cycles. CRT will be start after cycle 6. Then, ezabenlimab will be administered in the adjuvant setting up to 10 months from cycle 1. Eligible candidates include patients with treatment-naïve histologically proven locally advanced SCAC, an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and age ≥18 years. The primary endpoint is the clinical complete response rate at 10 months from the first cycle of mDCF plus ezabenlimab. Main secondary endpoints are the major pathological response (complete/near-complete response) and biological CR (HPV ctDNA negative) after induction treatment. Other secondary endpoints include the ORR, OS, PFS, RFS, HRQoL and safety. An extensive ancillary study will be performed to predict response or resistance to treatment. Peiffert D et\\xa0al.

NIVO may enhance antitumor activity in combination with 1L standard therapies within a subset of patients (pts) with mCRC. CheckMate 9X8 evaluated NIVO + mFOLFOX6/BEV vs mFOLFOX6/BEV in 1L mCRC (NCT03414983). Methods: Adults with previously untreated, unresectable, mCRC were randomized 2:1 to NIVO 240 mg + mFOLFOX6/BEV Q2W (NIVO + standard-of-care [SOC]) or mFOLFOX6/BEV Q2W (SOC). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1. Key secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results: 195 pts were randomized to NIVO + SOC (n = 127) or SOC (n = 68). Median (range) follow-up was 23.7 (0–33.2) months (mo; NIVO + SOC) vs 23.2 (0–32.3) mo (SOC). Median (range) duration of therapy was 9.9 (0.1–31.8+) mo (NIVO + SOC) and 7.7 (0.1–26.7+) mo (SOC). The HR (95% CI) for PFS was 0.81 (0.53–1.23; P = 0.30), which did not meet the prespecified threshold for statistical significance (median PFS, 11.9 mo in both arms; Table). PFS rates after 12 mo were higher with NIVO + SOC vs SOC (Table). ORR was 60% (NIVO + SOC) and 46% (SOC; odds ratio 1.72 [95% CI 0.96–3.10]) and median (95% CI) DOR was 12.9 (9.0–13.1) mo (NIVO + SOC) and 9.3 (7.5–11.3) mo (SOC; Table). Rates of grade 3−4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were higher with NIVO + SOC; however, no new safety signals were identified (Table). Biomarker analyses, including tumor mutational burden and baseline CD8 levels, will be presented. Conclusions: The primary endpoint of PFS was not met; however, NIVO + SOC showed higher PFS rates after 12 mo, a higher response rate, and more durable responses compared with SOC, along with acceptable safety, in 1L mCRC.

       "  '9Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based molecular residual disease (MRD) has the potential to select patients who may benefit more from standard-of-care (SOC) adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) by accurately assessing recurrence-risk post-surgery and by evaluating ACT efficacy. Here we present an analysis from GALAXY study, an observational study monitoring MRD, to evaluating the association of ctDNA dynamics with a short-term clinical outcome and ACT efficacy. Methods: A personalized tumor-informed assay (Signatera bespoke multiplex-PCR NGS assay) was used for post-surgical MRD detection in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Six-month disease-free survival (6M-DFS) rates were analyzed excluding patients enrolled in associated phase III trials (VEGA and ALTAIR). Results: Total 1,365 CRC patients enrolled between June 2020 and April 2021 were included in this analysis; 116 pStage I, 478 pStage II, 503 pStage III, and 268 oligomet resectable pStage IV (16% [42/268] received neoadjuvant chemotherapy). 6M-DFS rate by ctDNA dynamics from 4w to 12w were 98% in ‘negative to negative’ group (N = 618), 59% in ‘negative to positive’ (N = 32), 100% in ‘positive to negative’ (N = 58), and 45% in ‘positive to positive’ (N = 78), with a significant difference between ‘positive to negative’ and ‘positive to positive’ groups with hazard ratio (HR) of 52.3 (95% CI: 7.2-380.5; p < 0.001), with a median follow-up time of 6.6 months. Further, out of 188 patients who were MRD+ at 4w with available MRD status at 12w, 95 received SOC ACT (80/95 received fluoropyrimidine [FP] + oxaliplatin and 15 received FP alone) by an investigator’s decision. ctDNA clearance rate at 12w was significantly higher in ACT vs. non-ACT; 57% (54/95) vs. 8% (7/93) in pStage I-IV (p < 0.001), and 58% (42/72) vs. 11% (4/37) in pStage II-III (p < 0.001). In addition, ctDNA clearance rate at 24w was also significantly higher in ACT vs. non-ACT; 26% (7/27) vs. 0% (0/30) in pStage I-IV (p = 0.003), and 33% (7/21) vs. 0% (0/15) in pStage II-III (p = 0.03). Cumulative incidence of ctDNA clearance was significantly higher in ACT vs. non-ACT (67% vs. 7% by 24w; cumulative HR = 17.1; 95% CI: 6.7-43.4, p < 0.001). Among 4w-MRD+ patients, 6M-DFS rate was significantly higher in ACT vs. non-ACT; 84% vs. 34% (HR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.078-0.25; p < 0.001), which was seen in all stages, including pStage II. Conclusions: This analysis from the GALAXY study, is the largest MRD study to date, demonstrating the association of ctDNA dynamics with improved clinical outcomes in MRD+ patients. Our study shows that stratifying post-surgical treatment decisions using the assay can identify patients likely to benefit from ACT across all stages, including pStage II. ctDNA-guided adjuvant strategy will further be established by ongoing randomized VEGA and ALTAIR studies and will be presented in the future conferences.

       "  '10Background: It is uncertain if the addition of oxaliplatin (OX) to fluoropyrimidine plus bevacizumab (BEV) is suitable as initial therapy in elderly patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to confirm the superiority of the addition of OX in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). This JCOG trial was originally planned as a paralell study with NCCTG, but the NCCTG trial was terminated early. Methods: Key eligibility criteria included unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, and histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, aged 70-74 with PS 2 or 75 or older with ECOG PS 0-2. Eligible pts were randomized (1:1) to either no addition of OX or addition. Whether using 5-FU+levoleucovorin calcium (5-FU/l-LV) or capecitabine (CAPE) was declared before study entry; options included 5-FU/l-LV+BEV (C), CAPE+BEV (D), mFOLFOX7+BEV (E), or CapeOX+BEV (F). 5-FU/l-LV regimen omitted bolus 5-FU from the original sLV5FU regimen. The dose of CAPE was adjusted by estimated creatinine clearance. The primary endpoint was PFS. The planned sample size was 250 pts in total to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.75, with a one-sided alpha of 5% and 70% power. The decision rule is that the primary endpoint is met, and the point estimate of HR of overall survival (OS) is less than 0.8. Results: Between Sep 2012 and Mar 2019, 251 pts were randomized. 125 pts were allocated to no addition of OX and 126 pts to addition. Median age was 79, aged 70-74/75-79/80-84/85+:5%/45%/37%/13%, PS 0/1/2:53%/39%/7%. Of 251 pts, 241 pts had PFS events and 223 pts had OS events. Median PFS (mPFS) was 9.4 months (M) (95%CI 8.3–10.3) in no addition of OX and 10.0M (9.0–11.2) in addition (HR 0.837, 90.5%CI [0.673–1.042], one-sided p = 0.086). Median OS was 21.3M (18.7-24.3) in no addition and 19.7M (15.5–25.5) in addition of OX (HR 1.054 [0.810–1.372]). Response rate was 29.5% (21.2-38.8) in no addition of OX and 47.7% (38.1-57.5) in addition. Proportion of pts whose EQ-5D scores improved from baseline to post-treatment in overall score did not differ (odds ratio 0.94 (0.51-1.75)). The deaths of 1 pt in no addition of OX and in 3 pts in addition were deemed treatment-related. Conclusions: The addition of OX has no survival benefit over no addition.

       "  '11Background: Six months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III colon cancer (CC) remains a standard in high-risk stage III patients. Early treatment discontinuation (ETD) could worsen the prognosis. In addition, there is current lack of data on the prognostic impact of early oxaliplatin only discontinuation (EOD). Methods: We studied the prognostic impact of ETD and EOD in patients with stage III CC who participated in 11 relevant clinical trials of the ACCENT and IDEA databases, where patients were planned to receive 6 months of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX or CAPOX). ETD was defined as discontinuation of treatment before 75% of cycles of chemotherapy. EOD was defined as discontinuation of oxaliplatin only, while continuing the fluoropyrimidine, before 75% of cycles of oxaliplatin. Association between ETD/EOD and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was assessed by Cox model adjusted for prognostic factors. Results: ETD analysis included 10,444 patients (FOLFOX n = 7,033; CAPOX n = 3,411), with 20.9% of patients with ETD (17.8% with FOLFOX and 27.2% with CAPOX, p < 0.001). Out of 7,243 patients, 18.8% experienced EOD (17.4% FOLFOX versus 21.4% with CAPOX, p < 0.001). Compared to patients without ETD or EOD, patients with ETD or EOD were statistically more likely to be women, older, with higher ECOG-PS ≥ 1, and in addition for ETD, a Body Mass Index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2. In multivariate analyses, ETD was associated with a decrease in DFS and OS in the overall population (HR: 1.40 95%CI 1.23-1.58, p < 0.001 and HR: 1.51 95%CI 1.31-1.74, p < 0.001, respectively). The same pattern was present with FOLFOX and CAPOX regimen, and also in low-risk and high-risk groups for each regimen with the exception of the CAPOX regimen in the low-risk group for DFS and OS. By contrast, EOD was not associated with reduced DFS or OS in the overall population (HR: 1.10 95%CI 0.77-1.58, p = 0.6 and HR: 0.97 95%CI 0.62-1.52, p = 0.9, respectively), in the low-risk group (HR: 0.97 95%CI 0.56-1.66, p = 0.9 and HR: 0.97 95%CI 0.51-1.82, p = 0.9, respectively) and high-risk group (HR: 1.22 95%CI 0.74-2.02, p = 0.4 and HR: 1.05 95%CI 0.53-2.08, p = 0.9, respectively) and for all subgroups of regimen. Conclusions: In patients treated with 6 months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III CC, ETD was associated with a decrease in DFS and OS. By contrast, EOD was not significantly associated with poorer outcomes. In case of relevant neurotoxicity during a 6 months schedule, these data are not in favor of continuing oxaliplatin beyond 75% of planned cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, and demonstrate that fluoropyrimidines remain the cornerstone of adjuvant chemotherapy in localized CC.',\n",

       "  '12Background: Encorafenib (E) and cetuximab (C) offers short-lived response and survival benefit for patients (pts) with MSS, BRAFV600E metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). BRAF + EGFR inhibition induced a transient MSI-H phenotype in preclinical models of MSS, BRAFV600E CRC and may prime these tumors for response to immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies like nivolumab (N). Methods: In this single-arm, single-institution, phase I/II clinical trial, pts with treatment-refractory MSS, BRAFV600E metastatic CRC were eligible. No prior BRAF inhibitors, anti-EGFR antibody, or immunotherapy was permitted. Pts received E (300 mg PO daily), C (500 mg/m2 IV q14 days), and N (480 mg IV q28 days). The primary endpoints were best overall response (RECIST 1.1) and safety/tolerability (CTCAE v5). A Simon two-stage design (H0: p≤.22; Ha: p≥.45, where p= percentage of pts with radiographic response) was employed using a one-sided α=.05 and β=.20. In the first stage, ≥ 4/15 responses were needed in order for the trial to enroll 11 additional pts. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated via Kaplan-Meier. Results: All 26 pts have been enrolled - 23 patients treated, and 21 evaluable for response so far. Median age is 59 years (range, 32-85), and 14 (54%) are female. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (AE) occurred in 4/22 (18%) patients. Grade 3 AEs included colitis, maculopapular rash, leukocytosis, and elevated amylase/lipase (all N=1). Grade 4 AEs in a single patient were myositis/myocarditis. Overall response rate is 45% (95% CI, 23-68), and disease control rate is 95% (95% CI, 75-100). Median PFS is 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.5-NA). Median OS is 11.4 months (95% CI, 7.6-NA). For the 9 pts thus far with responses, median duration of response is 8.1 months (95% CI, 7.3-NA). Updated results will be presented. Conclusions: E + C + N is effective and well-tolerated for pts with MSS, BRAFV600E metastatic CRC. The E+C+N regimen met its predefined efficacy endpoint and suggests a role for immunotherapy as a novel combination approach for this specific subpopulation of MSS metastatic CRC. A follow-up randomized phase II trial (SWOG 2107) to evaluate encorafenib/cetuximab with or without nivolumab in pts with MSS, BRAFV600E metastatic CRC will activate in early 2022.

       "  '13Background: Optimal treatment duration with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for MSI/dMMR mCRC pts remains to be determined. Different durations are used, usually a fixed duration of 2 years or treatment until progression or toxicity. The GERCOR NIPICOL phase II study evaluated 1 year of therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab for MSI/dMMR mCRC pts. Here, we present the efficacy data with 16 months of additional follow-up since the primary analysis. Methods: MSI/dMMR mCRC pts previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan ± targeted therapies received nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q3W for 4 cycles, then nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W until progression or a maximum of 20 cycles. Second course of nivolumab was permitted for pts who completed the predefined year of treatment and had later progressive disease (PD). Objectives were to evaluate response rates, progression-free survival (PFS) per iRECIST, and overall survival (OS). A landmark analysis was performed for PFS in pts who remained alive and progression-free at 1 year (theoretical end of treatment). Results: Of 57 pts included between Dec 2017 and Nov 2018, 36 (63%) completed the predefined 1-year duration of treatment. Reasons of premature treatment discontinuation were PD or death (n = 13), adverse event (n = 7), and the pt wish (n = 1). Overall median follow-up was 34.5 months. One, 2, and 3-year PFS rates were respectively 75.4% (95% CI 62.0-84.6), 70.0% (95% CI 56.2-80.1), and 70.0% (95% CI 56.2-80.1). One, 2, and 3-year OS rates were 84.1 (95% CI 71.7-91.4), 78.4% (95% CI 65.1-87.1), and 73.1% (95% CI 58.4-83.4), respectively. 42/57 pts were progression-free and alive at 1 year. Among them, median follow-up was 35.0 months and the 24-month PFS rate was 92.9% (95% CI 79.5-97.6%). PD was observed in three pts whose 12-month status was stable disease (SD). These three pts received a second course of nivolumab: two achieved PR and one had PD. Conclusions: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab with a fixed duration of 1 year continued to show durable activity in pts with chemoresistant MSI/dMMR mCRC after 3 years of follow-up. Reexposure to nivolumab seems to provide additional antitumor activity for pts experiencing late resistance after discontinuation of immunotherapy. Clinical trial information: NCT033501260.',\n",

       "  '14Background: Robotic surgery for rectal cancer is gaining popularity, but persuasive evidence on long-term oncological outcomes is lacking. This multicenter randomized controlled trial compared robotic and conventional laparoscopic surgery regarding surgical quality and long-term oncological outcomes among patients with middle and low rectal cancer. Methods: This superiority trial was undertaken at 11 hospitals in 8 Chinese provinces. Patients with middle (> 7–12 cm from anal verge) or low (0–7 cm from anal verge) rectal adenocarcinoma, cT1–T3 N0–1 or ycT1–T3 Nx after preoperative radio-/chemoradiotherapy, and no evidence of distant metastasis were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive robotic or conventional laparoscopic surgery. Secondary (short-term) end points (surgical quality, pathological radicality, and postoperative recovery) were compared using modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Three-year locoregional recurrence rate as the primary endpoint is expected by the end of 2023. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02817126). Results: Between July 2016 and December 2020, 1240 patients were enrolled; 1180 were included in the mITT analysis (591 in robotic and 589 in laparoscopic group). There were significantly more sphincter-preserving surgeries (low anterior resections) performed in the robotic group (83.1% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.008). With more macroscopic complete resections (95.4% vs. 91.9%, p = 0.012), robotic surgery had better integrity of the mesorectal fascia, and had lower circumferential resection margin positivity rate (4.0% vs. 7.1%, difference = -3.1%, 95% confidence interval = -6.0% to -0.5%, p = 0.023) and more lymph nodes harvested (median, 15.0 vs. 14.0, p = 0.004). Robotic surgery also reduced the open conversion rate (1.7% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.021), estimated blood loss (median, 40.0 ml vs. 50.0 ml, p < 0.001), intraoperative complication rate (5.4% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.029), and 30-day postoperative complication rate (Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher, 16.1% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.003), leading to better postoperative recovery and shorter postoperative hospital stay (median, 7.0 days vs. 8.0 days, p < 0.001). The 30-day postoperative mortality was similar between the two groups (0.2% vs. 0.2%, p > 0.999). Conclusions: Robotic surgery for middle and low rectal cancer significantly reduced surgical injury, improved oncological radicality, and promoted postoperative recovery compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery.

       "  '15Background: Immune check point inhibitors (ICI) are ineffective in MSSCRC. Combination of ICI with targeted agents has the potential to alter the tumor microenvironment and render these tumors vulnerable to ICI. We report the results of the multicenter study of rego and pembro in a diverse patient population with advanced MSSCRC. Methods: This was an investigator-initiated study and enrolled patients (pts) who had failed/were intolerant of chemotherapy at 3 sites. A 3+3 design was used for phase I to evaluate escalating doses of rego (80,120,160, days 1-14/21) in combination with pembro (200m/q3weeks). The primary endpoint was dose limiting toxicities during the first cycle. For phase II, pts received rego at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) with pembro. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR). The study was powered to show an improvement in PFS from 1.9 months (CORRECT data) to 2.85 months. Estimated sample size for phase II was 63 pts. Results: Study started in 7/2019 and accrual completed in 7/2021. Of 73 pts, 10 enrolled in phase I and 63 in phase II. RP2D of rego was 80 mg, days 1-14/21, and 70 pts treated at that dose. As of Sep 14, 11 pts remain on treatment. At baseline, median age was 54 years (23-81), 51% female, 53% white, 19% Asian, 12% black, and 11% Hispanic, median prior lines of therapy 2 (1-5), primary tumor location rectosigmoid/rectal 13%, KRAS mutated 68%, BRAF mutated 5%. Liver metastases was present in 78% of the pts. There was no grade 4 toxicity. The most common grade 3 toxicities were rash (20%), followed by hand-foot syndrome and HTN (7%). Dose modification was required in 14%. The most common reason for discontinuation was disease progression (85%), followed by withdrawal of consent (12%). With a median follow up of 5.3 (range:0.6-24.4) months, median PFS was 2.0 (1.8 -3.5) months, and median OS was 10.9 (5.3-NR) months. In 16 pts (23%), with non-liver metastatic disease PFS was 4.3 (1.9-8.4) months. No objective response was observed. Stable disease was observed in 49% of pts, median duration of stable disease was 2 (0.2-18.8) months. Conclusions: This is the largest trial of combination of ICI + rego in MSSCRC reported to date. The trial didn’t meet its primary endpoint, though the median OS is provocative. Analysis of biomarkers for identification of pts with longer duration of benefit is ongoing.

       "  '16Background: Total neoadjuvant therapy with induction chemotherapy and chemoradiation (chemoRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinomas. Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) rectal tumors respond poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PD-1 blockade is effective in patients with metastatic dMMR colorectal cancers, but its efficacy has not been established in the neoadjuvant setting. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade in dMMR locally advanced rectal cancer. Methods: We designed a prospective, single-arm, phase II study in which patients with stage II and III dMMR rectal cancer receive neoadjuvant dostarlimab (anti-PD-1) for a total of 6 months. The co-primary objectives are to determine the overall response rate (ORR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) or clinical complete response rate (cCR) with or without chemoRT. Tumor assessment with endoscopic evaluation is performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months; imaging is performed at pretreatment baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Patients with cCR by previously established criteria are eligible for non-operative management without chemoRT. Those with residual disease after neoadjuvant dostarlimab receive standard chemoRT. Following chemoRT, any patient failing to achieve a cCR is then managed surgically. Results: A total of 13 patients have been enrolled, with median age 52 years (range 26-78), 77% female, and 92% with node-positive disease by rectal MRI. The ORR is 100% in the 12 patients who have undergone at least a 3-month evaluation. Seven patients have completed induction therapy and all 7 (100%) have achieved a cCR and are undergoing observation without chemoRT or surgery. The rate of progressive disease thus far is 0%. No patients have required chemoRT or surgery. There have been no serious adverse events. Conclusions: Single agent neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with dostarlimab is effective and well-tolerated in locally advanced dMMR rectal adenocarcinoma and allows patients to avoid chemoradiation and surgery. This suggests a potential new paradigm for treatment of dMMR locally advanced rectal cancer. Follow up and further patient accrual is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT04165772.',\n",

       "  '17Background: According to the World Health Organization GLOBOCAN database, in 2019, approximately 1.8 million new colorectal cancer cases were diagnosed, and almost 861,000 deaths were reported. In the United States, CRC is the third most frequent type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Although the overall incidence of CRC among the Hispanic population has been declining over the last decades, recently, a dramatic increase in CRC incidents among Hispanics younger than 50 years of age (early-onset CRC) has been reported. The increase in the incidence of early-onset CRC is markedly more significant in Hispanic-Latino (HL) patients population (45%) than in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) (27%) and African-Americans (AA) (15%). Additionally, in contrast to NHW, Hispanics have a worse survival rate. The exact reason for these racial disparities and the biology of CRC in the HL population are not well understood. Therefore, we performed this study to better understand the biology of the disease in HL patients, which might help to identify new directions for targeted therapy. Methods: For the study, 52 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples were collected and analyzed. We compared the results with individual patient clinical histories and outcomes. Of 52 patients with mCRC, 52 (100%) were identified as HL. We identified several commonly altered genes in HL patients (APC, TP53, KRAS, GNAS, PICK3CA, and NOTCH). Compared to those in other studies. Results: Mutation frequencies in the APC gene were significantly higher among HL patients with mCRC. Moreover, the prevalence of the APC mutation was significantly higher among male HL patients compared to female patients. The combination of mutations in the APC, NOTCH, and KRAS genes in the same tumors was associated with a higher risk of progression after the first-line of chemotherapy and worse overall survival. In addition, mutations in the combination of GNAS and AURKA genes were associated with a significantly higher risk of progression after the first-line of chemotherapy. Conclusions: The data support the notion that the molecular drivers of colon cancer might be different in HL patients compared to other racial/ethnic groups.',\n",

       "  '18Background: Racial and ethnic minorities in the US are at increased risk of developing and dying from colorectal cancer. Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, among which are delayed presentation and initial disease management. We aimed to identify groups at highest risk to help address these disparities. Methods: Using the 2010-2017 National Cancer Database (NCDB), we analyzed clinical tumor stage at presentation and pathologic stage for adult patients (age≥18) diagnosed with primary colon cancer. We also examined trends in upstaging, downstaging, and delays >42 days between presentation and surgical intervention. We compared these outcomes by race/ethnicity using multivariable logistic or median regression, with select demographics, facility factors, and treatment details as covariates. Results: Fifty-one percent of patients with known clinical tumor stage (122,452/239,939) were diagnosed with stage III/IV at presentation, and 41% of those with known pathologic stage (123,009/298,716) had stage III/IV disease. In multivariable analysis, Black (OR 1.18, p<0.01) and Southeast Asian (OR 1.12, p=0.02) patients were significantly more likely than White patients to present with clinical stage III/IV. Black (OR 1.08, p<0.01), Hispanic (OR 1.07, p<0.01), East Asian (OR 1.28, p<0.01), and Southeast Asian (OR 1.40, p<0.01) patients were significantly more likely than White patients to have pathologic stage III/IV. Both clinical and pathological stage were available for 96,959 patients. Among those with clinical stage 0/I/II, Hispanic (OR 1.08, p=0.04), East Asian (OR 1.38, p<0.01) and Southeast Asian (OR 1.27, p=0.01) patients had significantly higher odds than White patients of being upstaged to pathologic stage III/IV. Among those with clinical stage III/IV, Black patients (OR 0.85, p=0.02) had significantly lower odds than White patients of being downstaged to pathologic stage 0/I/II. Black (OR 1.42, p<0.01), Hispanic (OR 1.33, p<0.01) and Southeast Asian (OR 1.23, p=0.05) patients had higher odds than White patients of waiting >42 days between presentation and surgery. Conclusions: Upstaging of colon cancer between diagnosis and surgery is disproportionately experienced by non-white patients. Surgical delays may partly explain this finding. Targeted interventions to avoid surgical delays as well as further research on the reasons (e.g., differences in tumor characteristics) for upstaging are needed to address this disparity.Disease staging & surgical delays, by race/ethnicity.Race/EthnicityOR (Clinical Stage III/IV)p-valueOR (Pathologic Stage III/IV)p-valueOR(Being Upstaged)p-valueOR(>42 day delay)p-valueBlack1.18<0.011.08<0.011.030.221.42<0.01Hispanic1.030.151.07<0.011.080.041.33<0.01East Asian0.920.061.28<0.011.38<0.010.860.11Southeast Asian1.120.021.40<0.011.270.011.230.05OR = Odds Ratio',\n",

       "  '19Background: While colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been decreasing overall, incidence in adults under age 50 has been rising both nationally and across Colorado. National guidelines have adapted to recognize this trend, but knowledge gaps regarding early-onset CRC remain. This group has previously established rising early-onset CRC incidence in Colorado, as well as later stage at diagnosis and worse prognosis. This study examines demographics, treatment, survival, and concomitant disease among patients < 50 and diagnosed with CRC across a multicenter healthcare system in Colorado in order to better understand early-onset CRC. Methods: We analyzed 1,192 CRC cases in patients < 50 from the Colorado Health Data Compass database and cross-referenced these cases with the Colorado Central Cancer Registry to examine for association of gender, race/ethnicity, BMI, zip code, insurance type, stage, and concomitant medical conditions with overall survival and oncologic treatment modality. Logistic regressions were used to evaluate the relationships between chemotherapy and the important variables while adjusting for covariates, with 95% confidence intervals reported. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to evaluate the relationships between overall survival and the important variables while adjusting for covariates, with 95% confidence intervals reported. Results: Overall, early-onset CRC in our population was 2.8% stage I, 6.3% stage II, 12.7% stage III, 18.5% stage IV, and 59.8% were unstageable or no stage recorded. Surgical treatment was associated with a 52% improvement in overall survival. Chemotherapy treatment was not associated with any survival changes in stage II disease. Radiation treatment, insurance type, number of concomitant conditions, geographic location, and race/ethnicity were not associated with overall survival. Upon exploring chemotherapy relationships, patients from urban areas were significantly more likely to receive chemotherapy than patients from rural areas, while adjusting for ethnicity, inpatient encounters, and stage (OR 5.55, p = 0.001). Conclusions: While less is known about CRC in patients < 50, trends are emerging that are not as well described in a traditional CRC population. The difference between urban and rural patients and their rates of chemotherapy points to a potential disparity in access to care, particularly when considering advanced stage CRC. This persisted through insurance type, indicating that distance from an infusion center, rather than ability to pay, is more likely to be driving this relationship. Further research is needed to determine if these findings are generalizable to the larger early-onset CRC population, and how access may be affecting care for this population.',\n",

       "  '20Background: Individuals with rectal cancer require a number of pre-treatment investigations to determine the local-regional and overall stage of disease. Stage of rectal cancer determines treatment plan; therefore incomplete or inadequate staging may result in sub-optimal care and outcomes. Methods: This is a population based study of all individuals undergoing surgical resection for rectal cancer in Ontario, Canada (population 14.6 million) between 2010 and 2019. Individuals were identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry which includes approximately 95% of all incident cases of rectal cancer in the province. “Complete Staging” in Rectal Cancer has previously been defined and includes assessments of distant metastasis, local-regional stage and an attempt at colonic assessment for synchronous lesions. Patient and care provider characteristics, staging investigations, stage of disease, treatments and long-term outcomes were determined using linked administrative databases. Results: The study cohort included 10,957 individuals with rectal cancer; 24% Stage I, 21% Stage II, 40% Stage III, 7% Stage IV, 8% Missing Stage. The average age was 65 (STD 12.6) and males accounted for 63% of the study population. Incomplete staging occurred in 26%, with incomplete local regional staging being the most common deficiency (21%). Increasing patient age (< 0.001), low volume surgeons (P < 0.001) and low volume hospitals (P < 0.001) were associated with incomplete staging. There was significant regional variation in the completeness of staging (low 68% - High 84%). In those with locally advanced rectal cancer (Stage II and Stage III), incomplete staging was associated with lower rates of preoperative radiation oncology assessments (27% vs. 80%, P < 0.001) and medical oncology assessments (12% vs. 39%, P < 0.001). In addition, incomplete staging was associated with lower rates of any radiation (pre or postoperative) (45% vs. 82%, P < 0.001), lower rates of preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (22% vs. 74%, P < 0.001) and higher rates of post operative radiation (23% vs. 8.3%, P < 0.001). Those with incomplete staging had a lower 5 year overall survival (73% vs. 81%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: In this study, we identified several modifiable risk factors for incomplete staging prior to treatment for rectal cancer. Incomplete staging likely results in suboptimal care in this population, as demonstrated by less oncology referrals and less use of appropriate neoadjuvant therapy.',\n",

       "  '21Background: There are 32 counties and 2.8 million people in the Texas border region. The population is 88.4% Hispanic with estimates that 47% lack health insurance - not including non-US citizens, who are more likely to lack health insurance than US citizens. In 2014, 7 of the 20 US counties with the lowest CRC screening rates were in Texas, 6 of which were Texas border counties. It is unknown how the incidence of CRC in Texas border counties has changed over time compared to non-border counties. In this study, we investigate changes in the incidence of CRC in Texas border counties between 2000 and 2017. Methods: Data were obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Service’s Texas Cancer Registry. Cases of patients aged 18 or older between 2000 and 2017 were included in our analysis. Cases were excluded if they contained incomplete information regarding age, sex, year of diagnosis, site of diagnosis or poverty level. Simple descriptive statistics were calculated for all covariates. Chi-square tests of independence were created to examine the association between each categorical variable and border county status. Age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR) were created for the state overall and by border status. SAS v9.4 was used for all data analysis. Results: In border counties from 2000 to 2017, the overall AAIR decreased from 65.9 (per 100,000) to 56.7. In those 50-64 years old and 65 years and older residing in border counties, the AAIR increased from 63.3 to 78.1 and decreased from 244 to 176.1, respectively. In non-border counties from 2000 to 2017, the overall AAIR decreased from 85.2 (per 100,000) to 57.3. In those 50-64 years old and 65 years and older residing in non-border counties, the AAIR decreased from 94.9 to 78.0 and from 303 to 168.5, respectively. Conclusions: The overall AAIR of CRC was lower in Texas border counties compared to non-border counties, which is likely a consequence of lower screening rates in border counties. The overall AAIR decreased at a slower rate in Texas border counties compared to non-border counties, which may represent lower rates of utilization of CRC screening over time in border counties. The increase in the AAIR among those 50-64 years old in Texas border counties warrants further investigation.',\n",

       "  '22Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), and colitis-associated CRC (CA-CRC) mortality is on the rise. It has been postulated that CA-CRC may be contributing to the increasing prevalence of early-onset CRC (EOCRC) but supportive studies are currently lacking. Molecular and clinical differences between CA-CRC and sporadic-CRC (S-CRC) have been reported, however outcomes for CA-CRC remains unclear. Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC) is a rare subtype of CRC which is seen at higher frequencies, along with mucinous histology, in both CA-CRC and EOCRC. In this study, we validate the association of SRC and mucinous (SRC/M) histology with CA-CRC and EOCRC, and utilize it to estimate the amount of EOCRC attributable to undiagnosed or subclinical IBD. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using three independent mCRC patient datasets from MDACC. The mATTACC discovery cohort consisted of 32 IBD- and 425 S-mCRC patients enrolled in a prospective biomarker trial. Validation of tumor histology was completed with a tumor registry (n=1696), excluding the MSI-High samples, and a real-world evidence (RWE) cohort from MDACC containing 269 CA-mCRC and 29,596 S-mCRC patients, was used as our validation cohort. Results: In the mATTACC cohort SRC/M histology was found in 37.5% of CA-mCRC and 11.7% of S-mCRC, showing a strong association between SRC/M and CA-mCRC (OR = 4.54, 95% CI: 2.19-9.43). The RWE cohort confirmed the correlation of SRC/M with CA-mCRC (28.6%) relative to S-mCRC (11.4%) patients (OR = 3.13, 95%CI: 2.39-4.09). An association was found between SRC/M and EOCRC (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.24-1.47). By comparing the prevalence of SRC/M in EOCRC and late-onset CRC and correcting by the proportion of CA-CRC cases with SRC/M histology, we estimate that between 8.28% to 10.15% of EOCRC may attributable to undiagnosed/subclinical IBD. Using the RWE cohort, median overall survival was determined to be lower for CA-mCRC (31m) relative to S-mCRC (39m; p=0.007), yielding a HR of 1.26 (95% CI: 1.06-1.48). CA-mCRC patients with EOCRC (25m) were also found to have significantly worse outcomes than S-mCRC patients (40m) with EOCRC (p=0.0005; HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.23-2.11). Within CA-mCRC, patients with SRC or SRC/M histology (21m) had decreased OS compared to mucinous histology (51m), indicating the poor prognosis of SRC in CA-mCRC (p=0.028; HR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.3-0.94). Conclusions: Tumor biology consistent with CA-CRC, including SRC/M histology, may be present in 8.3% – 10.2% of patients with EOCRC without a clinical diagnosis of IBD, and harbors worse outcomes. Although other confounding biology may be underlying this association, recognition of undiagnosed IBD in CRC patients, especially those with metastatic disease, is important as it may impact prognosis and treatment strategies for this high-risk patient population.',\n",

       "  '23Background: Prevailing methods for patient recruitment in large prospective studies can be time consuming, expensive, and introduce selection bias against patients with low health literacy or reduced access to healthcare. Previous clinical trials have reported low recruitment of women, minorities, and individuals who face socioeconomic barriers; a concern which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we describe a novel recruitment strategy that helps to address healthcare disparities. This study will support a pre-market approval application to the FDA for a multi-factor RNA-FIT assay for detection of colorectal neoplasia in average-risk individuals between the ages of 45-75. Methods: A decentralized clinical trial (CRC-PREVENT) was launched through a digital campaign (https://www.colonscreeningstudy.com/; NCT04739722) after the RNA-FIT test system entered design-lock. Online advertisements were published on multiple social media sites and engagement with materials directed patients to an online screener. Participants who completed the screener were considered eligible for enrollment if they met CRC-PREVENT inclusion/ exclusion criteria and were willing to complete all components of the clinical trial, including providing a stool sample prior to an optical colonoscopy. Results: After 3 months of active enrollment, 51,588 individuals have engaged with digital advertisements and completed pre-screener surveys to determine eligibility. In total, 35,280 individuals were deemed eligible based on survey response, and 13,294 eligible individuals also expressed interest in the CRC-PREVENT clinical trial. Of these individuals, 48% were female and 34% were over the age of 60 years old. Regarding race, interested individuals directly represented the intended use population: 17% were Black or African American, 2.7% were Asian, and 1.3% were Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or Alaskan Native. With respect to ethnicity, 8.4% identified as Hispanic or Latinx. The decentralized approach also permitted access to individuals with socioeconomic healthcare inequities: 27% had income under $29,999 and 14% were on Medicaid. Individuals were derived from all 48 continental United States, and of those who reported their residential location, approximately 3% were from rural areas. Conclusions: Use of a decentralized recruitment strategy permitted highly successful enrollment in the face of challenges associated with COVID-19. With respect to race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography, all metrics represented significantly more diverse populations than observed in traditional clinical studies. Decentralized enrollment mitigated selection bias, and will result in data more reflective of the intended use population. Clinical trial information: NCT04739722.',\n",

       "  '24Background: Early onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC, age < 50 years) is an emerging public health crisis, especially in minorities. We evaluated and compared the effects of Medicaid expansion on the incidence of EO-CRC among Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites across the United States. Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was used to collect data on newly diagnosed cases of EO-CRC (40-49 years) among the three races, across all stages, from 2010-2017. Data for 21 expansion states (ES) that expanded Medicaid in 2014, and 16 non-expansion (NES) states was analyzed, excluding the states which expanded after 2014.The yearly state-wise population of all three races was collected from the U.S Census Bureau for 2010-17. A segmented Poisson regression model with generalized estimating equations was used for statistical analysis. Results: Annual incidence (AI) of EO-CRC pre and post expansion, in ES was 6/100,000 and 9/100,000 in Hispanics; 17/100,000 and 21/100,000 in Blacks and 14/100,000 and 18/100,000 for Whites. In NES the AI, pre and post 2014 was 8/100,000 and 10/100,000 among Hispanics, 19/100,00 and 24/100,000 among Blacks and 16/100,000 and 20/100,000 among Whites. Rate of change in AI of EO-CRC among Hispanics was 4.3% per year (2010-14), and 9.8% (2014-17) for ES states; and 6.4% (2010-14), and 1% (2014-17) in NES; among blacks was 3.8 % per year (2010-14), and 1.3% (2014-17) for ES states; and 1.6% (2010-14), and 3.2% (2014-17) in NES. Among Whites, increase in AI was 4.3% per year (2010-14), and 6.3% (2014-17) for ES states; and 4.0% (2010-14), and 5.7% (2014-17) in NES. ES showed greater change in incidence after expansion compared to pre-expansion in the incidence of EO-CRC as compared to NES (p=0.03) in Hispanics, however no significant difference was noted among Blacks (p=0.33) and Whites(p=0.94). Racial groups did significantly differ with respect to the degree of change in pre and post expansion (2014) rates of incidence of EO- CRC in the ES, however, in the NES, there were significant difference between the Hispanics and Whites (p=0.01), but not between Blacks versus Whites.

       "  '25Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed in the US and Canada. WHO, Canadian Cancer Society (CCS), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Cancer Society (ACS) recommend that men and women begin CRC screening at age 50 or younger if at high risk. Recommended screening procedures: Annual occult fecal blood test (OFBT), a colonoscopy every 5 years, OFBT and colonoscopy every 5 years, or a colonoscopy every 10 years. According to The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, only 39% of CRC are diagnosed in stage I, 36% are diagnosed in stage II, 19% are diagnosed with metastasis. The corresponding 5-year survival rates are 89.8%, 67.7%, and 10.3%. Neither the CCS nor the ACS recommends a blood test to be done as part of screening. This is due to the fact that, until now, there has not been a blood test with adequate sensitivity or specificity for screening. Methods: In this study we discovered that aspartyl (asparaginyl) β-Hydroxylase (AABH) measurement in serum can be used as a screening test for CRC. AABH has been detected by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on the cell surface of different cancers including CRC. It has been detected by IHC in > 97% of tumor specimens tested (n > 210) but has not been found in tissue samples from normal individuals. Results: This observation and the observation that AABH is found in the serum of patients with cancer, but not in non cancer patients, led us to develop a Sandwich ELISA Assay to measure AABH in serum. In the current study we have quantified AABH levels in CRC patients and compared it with normal individual. Increased levels of AABH were found in the serum of 99% of patients with CRC in all different stages of Cancer (n = 277). In normal individuals, AABH was essentially undetectable in serum (n = 195). AABH was identified in serum from patients with CRC irrespective of cancer stage. All serum AABH levels for stages I, II, III and IV were more than 3.0 ng/mL. Conclusions: Thus, our data indicate that by measuring AABH in the serum, we should be able to detect CC at an earlier stage than it is currently detected, resulting to a much better 5-year survival for colon cancer.',\n",

We explored whether ultra-deep sequencing of cfDNA could improve sensitivity and specificity with respect to time-to-progression. Methods: 84 CRC patients UICC stage II/III were recruited into the prospective, observational study “Molecular Signatures in Colorectal Cancer”. Matched tumor tissue samples, plasma depleted blood cells (PDBC), and cfDNA (drawn 1 to 34 days after R0-resection, median 7 days) were processed with the Roche AVENIO Tumor Tissue and ctDNA Surveillance Kits*. Samples of 79 patients passed all quality controls, in particular cfDNA was sequenced ultra-deep with a median of 180 Mio. instead of 50 Mio. reads/sample. Somatic variants were identified with AVENIO Oncology Analysis software 2.0*. PDBC informed germline variants were removed. If a tissue baseline variant was detected in cfDNA with a significant adjusted p-value, the patient was defined ctDNA+, and ctDNA- otherwise. Results: 8 ctDNA+ patients (28 variants, median AF = 0.15%) were identified of which 4 had a progression of disease at two years. Sensitivity was 44% (95% CI [0.137, 0.788]), specificity was 94% (95% CI [0.86, 0.984]), positive predictive value was 50% (95% CI [0.157, 0.843]), and negative predictive value was 93% (95% CI [0.843, 0.977]). Comparison of time-to-progression of ctDNA+ and ctDNA- patients using the log-rank test resulted in a p-value of 0.0058. Comparison of survival times of ctDNA+ and ctDNA- patients resulted in a p-value of 0.0333. Multivariate analyses of times-to-progression resulted in ctDNA-status (p = 0.0022, hazard ratio (HR) = 7.098) and neoadjuvant therapy (p = 0.0010, HR = 6.618) as significant parameters. Conclusions: Even in this small cohort of CRC UICC stage II/III patients, MRD detection in post-surgery plasma is the strongest predictor of shorter time to progression. Ultra-deep sequencing of cfDNA samples did not influence MRD detection on a patient-level. *for Research Use Only; not for use in diagnostic procedures.',\n",

The present study aims to analyse the association between preoperative CEA and long-term outcomes when adjusted for other factors including Systemic Inflammatory Grade (SIG). Methods: The effect on overall/cancer specific survival (OS/CSS) of preoperative CEA (<5/5+) was examined in a regional cohort of patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer after adjustment for other clinicopathological factors including the SIR as measured by Systemic Inflammatory Grade (SIG). Results: 624 patients were identified undergoing curative surgery for colon cancer with a preoperative CEA available. For 3-year OS stratified by TNM Stage, CEA offered further prognostic value in patients with TNM Stage I (98% vs 75%, p=0.002), but not Stage II (p=0.444) or Stage III (p=0.351) disease. For 3-year OS stratified by SIG, CEA did not add further significant prognostic value for any SIG (all p>0.05). On multivariate analysis, age (HR 1.65, p=0.020), sex (HR 0.53, p=0.001), mode of presentation (HR 1.93, p=0.008), TNM Stage (HR 1.83, p<0.001) and SIG (HR 1.30, p<0.001) remained significant for OS, but not CEA (p=0.620). Conclusions: The present results show that there is limited prognostic value of preoperative CEA. The SIR as measured by SIG should be routinely measured prior to curative colonic surgery. A mandatory reporting dataset is required in colorectal cancer and should include SIG.

       "  '28Background: The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) has proven utility for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection in symptomatic patients. Most studies have examined FIT in symptomatic patients subsequently referred from primary care. We investigated associations between CRC and FIT in both referred and non-referred symptomatic patients. Methods: A retrospective, observational study of all patients with a FIT submitted Aug’18-Jan’19 in NHS GG&C was performed. Referral to colorectal/gastroenterology and decision to perform colonoscopy were recorded. FIT results were grouped as f-Hb<10/10-149/150-399/≥400ug/g. The MCN cancer registry identified new cases of CRC. Covariables were compared using the χ2 test. Multivariate binary logistic regression identified independent predictors of CRC. Results: 4968 patients were included. Raised FIT correlated with decision to refer (p<0.001) and scope (p<0.001). With 23-month median follow-up, 61 patients were diagnosed with CRC. These patients were older (median 69 vs. 59 years, cancer and no cancer respectively, p=0.001), more likely to be male (55.7% vs. 42.1%, p=0.033) and to report rectal bleeding (51.7% vs. 36.1%, p=0.013). FIT (<10 µg/g 8.2% vs. 76.7% and ≥400 µg/g 55.7% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) and anaemia (45.9% vs. 19.7%, p<0.001) were associated with CRC. On multivariate analysis, age (p=0.023), male sex (p=0.04), FIT (≥400 OR 54.256 (95% CI: 20.683-142.325; p<0.001)) and anaemia (OR 1.956 (1.071-3.574;p=0.029)) independently predicted CRC. 1 patient (0.04%) with a negative FIT and normal haemoglobin had CRC. Conclusions: Referral from primary care and secondary care investigation patterns were influenced by FIT. The combination of normal Hb and f-Hb excluded CRC in 99.96% of cases, providing excellent reassurance to those prioritising access to endoscopy services.',\n",

       "  '29Background: Appendiceal Cancers are a heterogenous group of rare tumors with distinct histopathologic and genomic alterations. These often have peritoneal spread that might not be easily detected on current imaging modalities, and conventional tumor markers may not lend diagnostic support. Hence, novel diagnostic techniques are needed. Measurement of ctDNA for recurrence risk prediction, response to therapy and and early diagnosis is a promising technique. However, limited published data exist in AC to validate the role and utility of ctDNA in clinical practice. Here we present a single institution experience of ctDNA analysis in patients with AC. Methods: ctDNA measurements of 37 pts with stage II-IV AC treated between 1/1/2019 and 9/15/2021 were reviewed retrospectively. ctDNA analysis was done using Signatera bespoke mPCR NGS assay. ctDNA results were compared to crossectional imaging, CEA levels, and clinical evaluation. Results: 19/37 patients (51%) had at least one positive ctDNA test result. Of those, 8 had testing done during the surveillance setting (two with grade 3, one with grade 2, two with grade 1, and three with unknown grade). Of those, 5 pts (62.5%) had positive ctDNA detected, while 33.33% had elevated CEA level, 25% had radiographic and 42.9% had clinical evidence of recurrence (Table). 7/14 (50%) pts had high-grade pathology and positive ct-DNA, 3/6 (50%) patients had low-grade (grade 1) pathology and positive ct-DNA findings. 4 patients had longitudinal ct-DNA measurements available which correlated well with their disease course. Median duration to recurrence (radiographic or laparoscopic) was 376 days. Median duration to the first positive ctDNA test was 370 days. Median duration to positive CEA after initial treatment was 475 days. Conclusions: Measurement of ctDNA can be a useful tool to follow disease course and to guide management decision-making in patients with AC. Prospective studies with serial measurements of ctDNA are planned. ct-DNA findings compared to CEA, radiographic and clinical evidence of recurrence in patients with AC.Ct-DNA detection5/8 (62.5%)CEA elevation2/6 (33.3%)Radiographic recurrence2/8 (25%)Clinical evidence of recurrence3/7 (42.9%)',\n",

However, there has been limited reports that investigated the safety and efficacy of vaccination in cancer patients and the optimal timing of vaccination during chemotherapy. We therefore investigated the effects of vaccination on treatment in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Methods: Our retrospective observational study included 52 patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer receiving chemotherapy at the medical hospital of Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Tokyo who had two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between May 2021 and September 2021. All patients had no history of COVID-19 infection. Treatment- and vaccination-related adverse events were recorded by outpatient interviews and self-reports. All adverse events were evaluated using CTCAE v5.0. Results: Characteristics of patients were as follows (N = 52): median age, 70y (range, 49–89); male/female, 30/22; ECOG PS 0, 75%; local/metastatic, 12/40; mean BMI, 23.4±4.1; comorbidities in 36 (cardiovascular in 24, diabetes in 8, kidney disease in 8, liver disease in 6, lung disease in 1); treatment (cytotoxic in 45, biologics in 23, immune checkpoint inhibitor in 4). Of the 52 patients, 45 received chemotherapy prior to vaccination; days from last dose to first vaccination, median 11 (range, 1–70); days from first to second vaccinations, median 21 (range, 21–41); days from first vaccination to chemotherapy, median 10 (range, 2–34). 11 patients (24.4%) changed treatment schedule: 3 for safety reasons, 4 for myelosuppression and 4 for convenience. 4 patients stopped treatment due to disease progression. Following the first vaccination, 37 patients (82.2%) had adverse events (AEs): injection site pain (n = 35), fatigue (n = 6), fever (n = 3), headache (n = 2), gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 2), redness (n = 1), insomnia (n = 1). There was no treatment- and vaccine-related deaths. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that vaccine-related AEs in GI cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are tolerable, and treatment schedule changes could be minimized. Although careful monitoring is required, COVID-19 vaccination is also recommended for cancer patients toward the convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       "  '32Background: Primary care physicians (PCPs) provide essential support for cancer patients. Both primary and cancer care have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the US, cancer related encounters and screening decreased over 40% and 80% respectively in January to April 2020 compared to 2019 (London et\\xa0al JCO Clin Cancer Inform 2020). However, the impact of the pandemic on primary care access for cancer patients remains unclear. Methods: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study using administrative healthcare databases held at ICES in Ontario, Canada. Patients with a new gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy diagnosed within the year prior to the pandemic, between July 1 and Sept 30, 2019 (COVID-19 cohort), were compared to patients diagnosed in years unaffected by the pandemic, between July 1 – Sept 30, 2018 and July 1 – Sept 30, 2017 (pre-pandemic cohort). Both groups were followed for 12 months after initial cancer diagnosis. In the COVID-19 cohort, this allowed for at least 4 months of follow-up data occurring during the pandemic. The primary outcome was number of in-person and telemedicine visits with a PCP. Secondary outcomes were number of in-person and telemedicine visits with a medical oncologist, number of emergency department (ED) visits, and number of unplanned hospitalizations. Outcomes, reported as number of visits per person-year, were compared between the COVID-19 and pre-pandemic cohorts. Results: 2833 individuals diagnosed with a new GI malignancy in the COVID-19 cohort were compared to 5698 individuals in the pre-pandemic cohort. The number of in-person visits to PCPs per person-year significantly decreased from 7.13 [95% CI 7.05 – 7.20] in the pre-pandemic cohort to 4.75 [4.66 – 4.83] in the COVID-19 cohort. Telemedicine visits to PCPs increased from 0.06 [0.05 – 0.07] to 2.07 [2.01 – 2.12]. Combined in-person and telemedicine visits to PCPs decreased from 7.19 [7.11 – 7.26] to 6.82 [6.71 – 6.92]. In-person visits to medical oncologists decreased from 3.73 [3.68 – 3.79] to 2.87 [2.80 – 2.94], and telemedicine visits increased from 0.10 [0.10 – 0.11] to 0.95 [0.91 – 0.99]. Combined in-person and telemedicine visits to medical oncologists remained stable (3.84 [3.78 – 3.89] vs. 3.82 [3.74 – 3.90]). The number of ED visits per person-year decreased from 1.04 [1.01 – 1.07] in the pre-pandemic cohort to 0.93 [0.89 – 0.97] in the COVID-19 cohort. Unplanned hospitalizations did not show a significant change (0.56 [0.54 – 0.58] vs. 0.53 [0.50 – 0.56]). Conclusions: PCP visits for patients with newly diagnosed GI malignancies overall decreased during the pandemic, with a dramatic shift from in-person to telemedicine visits. Visits to medical oncologists also shifted from in-person to telemedicine, but the overall combined visits remained the same. While the number of ED visits decreased, the shift in ambulatory practices did not seem to impact the number of unplanned hospitalizations.',\n",

       "  '33Background: COVID-19 pandemic urged public health to imposed drastic reduction on endoscopic activities and surgery, leading to delays that still not have been caught up today. The Ministry of Health and Social Services (MSSS) of Quebec conducted a study of the impact of those measures and reported a 66% reduction of colonoscopy and a 30% reduction of colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery activities during the first wave (March to May 2020). Whether those reduction had an impact on diagnosis and staging of CRC remains unknown. Methods: Demographic information of CRC diagnosed at Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM) between January 1 2018 and March 12 2020 (pre-pandemic period), and March 13 2020 and June 30 2021 (pandemic period) were obtained from the SARDO registry and data regarding colonoscopy, surgery and staging at diagnosis (clinical or pathological as appropriate) were collected. Priority of elective colonoscopy was defined using the MSSS grading system ranging from P1 to P5. We compared delays to colonoscopy, delays to surgery and CRC staging of the pandemic period to the pre-pandemic period using one-way ANOVA, t tests and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Only delays in elective surgeries intended as first and curative treatment were analyzed. Results: 280 CRC diagnosis were made at the pre-pandemic period compared to 127 CRC diagnosis during the pandemic period. Mean diagnosis rates of the pandemic period tend to be lower (8.3 vs. 10.5 diagnosis/month, p=0.03) compared to the pre-pandemic period. 37.6% of patient in the pandemic period had a diagnosis of CRC during a hospitalization compared to 25.9% at the pre-pandemic period (p=0.048). 51.7% of elective colonoscopy leading to a diagnostic of CRC during the pandemic period did not meet required delays according to priority compared to 38.3% (p=0.049) during the pre-pandemic period. P3 colonoscopies (mostly indicated for a positive FIT and iron deficiency anemia) were the most affected (58.9 vs. 106.5 days, p˂0.001). P2 colonoscopy (indicated for suspected colorectal cancer) did not experienced an augmentation in delays (20.9 vs. 25.2 days, p=0.39). A mean of 3.5 elective curative surgeries per month were performed during the pandemic period compared to 3.4 at the pre-pandemic period (p=0.96), and mean delays for surgery were not affected (60.4 vs. 57 days, p=0.59). Stages at diagnosis did not differ (p=0.2). Most of the delayed colonoscopies led to a stage 0 or I CRC and did not lead to a higher stage at diagnosis (p=0.2). Conclusions: In our center, the COVID-19 pandemic led to overall less CRC diagnosis and increased diagnostic endoscopic delays without a higher rate of advanced stage disease. Delays for elective surgeries were quite similar once the CRC diagnostic established.',\n",

       "  '34Background: Survivors of colorectal cancer (CRC) are at risk for late effects of therapy and recurrence of cancer. With recurrence rates ranging between 30-40% (Siegal et\\xa0al., 2020), consistent, survivor-focused follow-up care is needed for early detection of late effects and recurrence (Jeffery et\\xa0al., 2019). CRC-related care delivery has been significantly disrupted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with decreases of 40% in CRC services in the United States between April 2020 and 2019 (Jammu, 2020). Consequentially, survivors may be left with fewer options for care, potentially causing increases in emergency room (ER) utilization. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined the patterns of ER utilization during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among young adult CRC survivors and assessed the relationship between self-reported care satisfaction and ER use. Eligible participants were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer between 18-39 years, between 6-36 months from diagnosis/relapse, English speaking, and based in the United States. Questions on care satisfaction were Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) questions. A multivariable logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between patient satisfaction and ER utilization, adjusting for factors related to the pandemic. Covariates for this analysis were chosen based on a significance of p < 0.1 at the univariate level, as well as general clinical significance. Results: The overall sample was N = 196, mean age (SD) was 32.1 years (4.5), and 116 survivors (59%) were male. Tumor location was colon or rectal in 42% and 57%, respectively, and the majority (56%) were diagnosed with stage 2 disease; 42.6% reported relapsed disease, and 20% had an ostomy. The majority of survivors (72.5%) had between 1-4 visits to an emergency room in the last 12 months and were categorized as normal users. Approximately 24.7% of the sample had greater than 4 visits to the ER in the last 12 months and were categorized as super-utilizers (Johnson et\\xa0al., 2015). Colorectal cancer survivors that reported a delay in their follow-up cancer care as a result of the pandemic were two times (OR: 2.05, 95% CI 0.99, 4.24) more likely to be super-utilizers of the ER. Higher self-reported satisfaction with overall care was associated with a 13.7% (OR: 0.86, 95%CI: -0.68, 1.09) lower likelihood of being a super-utilizer. Conclusions: This study found strong associations between delays in care, self-reported care satisfaction, and being a super-utilizer of the ER during the pandemic among young adult CRC survivors off treatment. Increasing patient satisfaction and minimizing care interruptions amongst this vulnerable population may aid in mitigating over-utilization in the ER during an ongoing pandemic.',\n",

       "  '35Background: Screening is highly effective at reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. Social media is extensively used to communicate about cancer care, yet little is known about the role of these online platforms in promoting CRC screening and early diagnosis. This study tracked Twitter discussions about CRC and characterized participating users to better understand public communication and perceptions of CRC on social media. Methods: Tweets containing references to CRC were collected from January 2020 to April 2021 using Twitter’s Application Programming Interface. Account metadata was used to predict user demographic information and classify users as either organizations, individuals, or influencers. Influencers represent high-impact users, defined by sizeable follower counts or verified Twitter status. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a natural language processing model, was used to identify observed topics of discussion in the collected tweets. Results: There were 72,229 unique CRC-related tweets by 31,170 users. Tweets reached a daily maximum after Chadwick Boseman, a well-known American actor, died from CRC. Individuals accounted for the majority of users (62.8%); organizations (35.2%); influencers (2%). Influencers made the most median impressions (35,853 impressions). Tweets contained the following topics: bereavement (27.9%), appeals for early detection (19.4%), research (14.0%), National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month (NCCAM) (13.7%), screening access (12.5%), and risk factors (12.4%). Tweets referencing bereavement had the most user engagement. Links to clinical trial enrollment information were the least shared type of embedded content (0.3%). Conclusions: Discussions about CRC largely focused on bereavement and early detection. Online coverage of NCCAM, personal experiences, and celebrity deaths related to CRC effectively stimulated goal-oriented tweets about early detection. Our findings suggest that Twitter may be a suitable platform for promoting and communicating future public health recommendations about CRC.',\n",

       "  '36Background: ML28897 (MyPathway) is a multi-basket trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of targeted therapies in non-indicated tumor types harboring relevant genetic alterations. In MyPathway, patients with treatment-refractory HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were enrolled and received pertuzumab plus trastuzumab. In order to facilitate contextualization of the outcome of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in MyPathway, we conducted a retrospective study to compare with the outcome in real-world HER2-amplified mCRC patients. Methods: Overall survival (OS) was used as the endpoint to compare outcomes from MyPathway (PER/HER arm) and the external control of HER2-amplified mCRC patients treated with any therapy except anti-HER2 therapy in the refractory setting (EC arm) from the US-based de-identified Flatiron Health-Foundation Medicine Clinico-Genomic Database (CGDB). The de-identified data originated from approximately 280 US cancer clinics (̃800 sites of care). OS was defined as time from first treatment to death in the PER/HER arm and from index date (initiation of treatment in the refractory setting) to death in the EC arm. For patients in the CGDB who had met study eligibility criteria at multiple index dates, all eligible index dates were used for the analysis. Standardized mortality ratio weighting based on propensity score was used for deriving the pseudo-population (post-weighting population). In the post-weighting population, multivariate Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare between the arms. A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the robustness and consistency of the primary analysis results. Results: The PER/HER arm consisted of 57 patients who had treatment-refractory mCRC with HER2 amplification and enrolled in the MyPathway by August 1, 2017 data cutoff. For the EC arm, 64 HER2-amplified mCRC patients were selected from CGDB collected between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2019. After applying the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria set to be similar to those in the MyPathway, 27 eligible index dates were selected from 18 eligible patients and used for primary analysis. In the post-weighting population, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS estimated by multivariate Cox regression model was 0.729 (95% CI: 0.184-3.900) and median survival in the PER/HER arm and the EC arm were 11.47 months (95% CI: 7.72-22.11) and 9.72 months (95% CI: 7.43-22.21), respectively. The results of the all sensitivity analyses were consistent with those in the primary analysis in terms of the point estimate of HR. Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the totality of findings suggests that the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab could have a potential benefit in OS for this population.',\n",

       "  '37Background: The survival benefit of FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab (Triplet) over Doublet in patients (pts) with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains controversial. We compared Triplet therapy with Doublet and explored the pts subgroups that could benefit from intensive chemotherapy (chemo) using real-world data. Methods: WJOG13219G was a multicenter, retrospective registry-based study of pts with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC who received first-line doublet or triplet chemo with/out molecular targeted agents in January 2014–December 2019. Primary analysis focused on pts who received VEGF inhibitor-containing chemo. To adjust pts background, the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method based on propensity scores calculated by age, ECOG PS, and disease status (recurrent/metastatic) was used. Results: A total of 232 pts from 33 hospitals were registered. After excluding 18 pts treated with anti-EGFR antibody-containing regimen and 44 without any targeted agents, 79 pts with Triplet and 91 with Doublet were analyzed. Baseline pts disposition was as follows: median age, 61 y; male proportion, 51%; PS 0/1/≥2, 63%/32%/5%; recurrent/metastatic, 26%/74%; and right/left primary, 68%/32%. Significant differences were noted in age and PS between the two groups. At median follow-up of 24.0 months, no statistical difference was noted in progression-free survival (PFS) (median 9.7 months of Triplet vs. 7.8 months of Doublet, HR = 0.89, P = 0.49) and overall survival (OS) (median 18.7 vs. 18.3 months, HR = 0.87, P = 0.52). The objective response rate was 53% in the Triplet group and 41% in Doublet (P = 0.10). Curative surgery after chemo was more frequent in the Triplet group than in Doublet (13% vs. 3%, P = 0.02). Two pts (3%) in the Triplet group and 6 (7%) in Doublet received immunotherapy as subsequent chemo; 13 (16%) and 6 (7%) also received BRAF inhibitor-containing therapy. IPTW analysis showed no difference between the two groups in PFS (HR = 0.82, P = 0.07) and OS (HR = 0.92, P = 0.57). In the subgroup analysis, pts with right-sided primary tumor in the Triplet group showed favorable trends of PFS (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65–1.16) and OS (HR, 0.71; 95%CI, 0.50–1.01), whereas pts with left-sided tumor in the Triplet group showed the reverse trends of PFS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.77–1.78) and OS (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.97–2.91). Conclusions: Some baseline characteristics were significantly different between real-world pts in the Triplet and Doublet groups. Although the Triplet group did not show any survival benefit compared with Doublet in the original and IPTW cohorts, pts with right-sided BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC could benefit from Triplet therapy.',\n",

       "  '38Background: Tegafur-uracil (UFT)/leucovorin calcium (LV) is an adjuvant chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer. We conducted a multicenter randomized trial to assess the noninferiority of a twice-daily compared with a three-times-daily UFT/LV regimen for stage II/III colorectal cancer in an adjuvant setting. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to group A (three doses of UFT [300 mg/m2 per day]/LV [75 mg per day]) or B (two doses of UFT [300 mg/m2 per day]/LV [50 mg per day]). The schedule of 28-day oral administration followed by a 7-day rest period was repeated. Five 35-day cycles were repeated. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival. The secondary endpoints included 5-year overall survival and toxicity. Results: In total, 386 patients were enrolled between July 28, 2011, and September 27, 2013. The 3-year disease-free survival rates of group A (n = 194) and B (n = 192) were 79.4% and 81.4% (95% confidence interval, 72.6-84.4-74.5-85.9), respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates of group A and B were 89.7% and 91.0% (95% confidence interval, 83.3-92.8-84.8-93.8), respectively. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in group A and B were diarrhea (3.9% vs. 7.3%), neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.6%), increase in aspartate aminotransferase (4.0% vs. 3.9%), increase in alanine aminotransferase (6.2% vs. 6.8%), nausea (1.7% vs. 3.4%), and fatigue (1.1% vs. 2.3%).

       "  '39Background: For patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), both trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) and regorafenib have received approval for use in the United States. The approvals of these agents were based on modest improvements in overall survival (OS) when compared to best supportive care plus a placebo in the RECOURSE and CORRECT trials, respectively. However, TAS-102 and regorafenib have never been directly compared in a prospective clinical trial. This study utilized a large real-world database to compare clinical outcomes with use of these agents. Methods: The nationwide de-identified Flatiron Health EHR-derived database was reviewed for patients diagnosed with mCRC between 2015 and 2020. Patients who received at least two lines of guideline recommended therapy for advanced disease followed by treatment with TAS-102 and/or regorafenib in the third line or greater were included for analysis. Patients who did not have a visit or medication order within 90 days of metastatic diagnosis were excluded to ensure patients were engaged with care at the data-providing institution. Kaplan-Meier and propensity score weighted models were used to compare survival outcomes between groups. Results: The records of 22,078 patients with mCRC were reviewed. Of the 4,407 patients that received at least two lines of standard therapy, 2,072 subsequently received regorafenib and/or TAS-102. Of these, 813 (39.2%) received TAS-102 alone, 275 (13.3%) TAS-102 followed by regorafenib, 736 (35.5%) regorafenib alone, and 248 (12.0%) regorafenib followed by TAS-102. Median OS for patients treated with TAS-102 alone or prior to receiving regorafenib was 6.66 months (95% CI 6.16-7.18) compared to 6.30 months (95% CI 5.80-6.79) for those treated with regorafenib alone or prior to receiving TAS-102 (p = 0.36). A propensity score weighted analysis controlling for age, race, stage at initial diagnosis, performance status at start of therapy, MSI/MMR status, RAS/RAF status, and line in which TAS-102 or regorafenib was received did not demonstrate a significant difference in survival between groups (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.90 -1.09, p = 0.82). A subgroup analysis did not identify any significant differences in outcomes stratified by age, performance status, MSI status, or RAS/RAF status. Conclusions: This analysis of real-world data did not identify a significant difference in survival outcomes in mCRC patients who were treated with TAS-102 or regorafenib. Median OS with both agents in a real-world setting was similar to that shown in the clinical trials that led to their approvals. This data should be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of TAS-102 and regorafenib with mCRC patients who are eligible for third line or greater treatment.',\n",

       "  '40Background: Commonly used systemic therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) for patients who have progressed through available first- and second-line regimens are regorafenib or trifluridine/tipiracil. For the subset of metastatic CRC patients with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusions, there are two additional approved options, larotrectinib or entrectinib. Our objective was to estimate and compare expected life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for metastatic TRK fusion CRC patients receiving larotrectinib versus entrectinib. Methods: We developed a partitioned survival model to project long-term comparative effectiveness of larotrectinib vs. entrectinib. Extrapolation was necessary as follow-up for both drugs was less than three years at the time of data reporting. Survival data for larotrectininb, assessed by independent review committee, were derived from a July 2020 analysis of 8 adult (≥18 years of age) TRK fusion CRC patients from the larotrectinib clinical trials program (NCT02122913, NCT02637687, and NCT02576431). Survival inputs for entrectinib were derived from 7 TRK fusion CRC patients from an October 2018 integrated analysis of three single arm trials (EudraCT 2012-000148-88, NCT02097810, and NCT02568267). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for both treatments were estimated using parametric survival distributions (Exponential, Weibull, Log-logistic, and Log-normal) fit to the available data. Exponential curves were used based on goodness-of-fit and clinical plausibility. QALYs were estimated by adjusting the time spent in the pre-progression and post-progression health states by health state utilities derived from publicly available literature. A constant discount rate of 3% was applied to LYs and QALYs. Model uncertainty was evaluated using one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 simulations. Results: Larotrectinib resulted in 2.11 LYs and 1.60 QALYs compared to 0.53 LYs and 0.41 QALYs for entrectinib. These estimates yielded additional gains for larotrectinib of 1.58 LYs and 1.19 QALYs against entrectinib. Conclusions: In metastatic TRK fusion CRC, larotrectinib may produce substantial life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-year gains compared to entrectinib. Additional data with longer follow-up times will further inform this comparison.',\n",

For patients with metastatic disease who have progressed through available first- and second-line options, the standard of care systemic therapies are regorafenib or trifluridine/tipiracil. Larotrectinib is approved for patients with TRK fusion advanced solid tumors including metastatic CRC.

       "  '42Background: Diet may be associated with survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among CRC survivors. Behavioral interventions using web and mobile technology are feasible and acceptable approaches to modify dietary behavior. Little is known about the effect of web-based dietary interventions on HRQOL among CRC survivors. Methods: The Survivor Choices for Eating and Drinking study (SUCCEED) was a pilot randomized wait-list controlled trial designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week (wk) web-based dietary intervention with daily text messages. In this secondary analysis, we estimated the effect of the intervention on HRQOL. Between 2017-2018, 50 CRC survivors were randomized (1:1) to intervention or control. Participants in the intervention arm received the intervention in wk 1-12 and were followed from wks 12-24. Participants assigned to the control arm for 1-12 wks had the option to receive the intervention in wks 13-24. In both arms, HRQOL and sleep quality were assessed using the EORTC QLQ–C30 and CR29 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at 0, 12, and 24 wks. Within- and between-group mean changes in HRQOL from enrollment to 12 and 24 wks were evaluated using independent t-test and paired t-test. Results: Follow-up was 88% complete at 12 and 24 wks in the intervention arm and 92% and 80% complete at 12 and 24 wks in controls. Participants mean age was 56 ± 9 y; 34% were men, 70% identified as non-Latinx White, 12% identified as Latinx, and 70% had stage III cancer. Between 0 and 12 wks, an increase in emotional functioning was observed in the intervention arm [mean change: 9.1; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2,16.0], while a decrease in emotional functioning was observed in controls (mean change: -5.1; 95%CI: -14.5,4.1; between-group mean difference: 14.3; 95%CI: 3.0,25.6). Between 0 and 24 wks, an increase in social functioning (mean change in intervention: 12.1; 95%CI: 2.1,22.1; between-group mean difference: 13.8; 95%CI: 2.1,25.5) and a decrease in fatigue (mean change in intervention: -9.1; 95%CI: -17.1,-1.1; between-group mean difference: -4.1; 95% CI: -15.8,7.6) was observed in the intervention arm. No other measures of HRQOL or sleep quality differed within or between arms. Conclusions: A web-based dietary intervention with daily text messages may improve emotional and social functioning among CRC survivors. Further study to evaluate the effect of web-based interventions on HRQOL among CRC survivors in larger studies may be merited. Clinical trial information: NCT02965521.',\n",

       "  '43Background: Three antiangiogenic (AA) drugs, bevacizumab (BEV), ramucirumab (RAM) and aflibercept (AFL) are recommended as the second-line (2L) treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the CRC treatment guidelines of multiple countries and regions including the US, EU and Japan. However, little evidence of 2L RAM and AFL after anti-EGFR antibodies (EGFRab) in first- line (1L) has been reported. This study assessed treatment sequence for mCRC patients who received 2L irinotecan-based chemotherapy with AA drug after FOLFOX + EGFRab in 1L, treatment duration from the start of 2L to the end of last treatment line (treatment duration from 2L) and factors associated with the treatment duration from 2L. Methods: This is a real-world observational study using a hospital-based claims database of 393 hospitals in Japan. The mCRC patients who started 1L treatment with FOLFOX + EGFRab between May 2016 and Sep 2019 (identification period) and further treated with irinotecan-based chemotherapy + AA drug were enrolled. The key outcomes were the treatment sequence, treatment duration from 2L by AA drug, and factors associated with the treatment duration from 2L. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Associated factors were investigated using Cox regression analysis. Results: Among 2,453 patients with 1L FOLFOX + EGFRab during the identification period, 506 patients who received the intended 2L therapies were enrolled in this study (mean age 63.5 years, male 66.6%). Number (%) of patients who used BEV, RAM and AFL in 2L was 345 (68.2), 120 (23.7) and 41 (8.1), respectively. Patient characteristics involving tumor location, metastatic site and prior anti-tumor therapy before starting 2L were similar among BEV, RAM and AFL. The treatment duration from 2L (median month and its 95%CI) was 11.1 (10.2-12.5) in the overall population and was similar among the patients who received BEV (10.8 [9.9-13.1]), RAM (11.2 [10.0-14.2]) and AFL (12.8 [6.9-NA]) in 2L. The treatment duration from 2L (median month and its 95%CI) for the patients who took or didn’t take proteinuria tests during 2L was 12.5 (11.1-15.2) and 8.5 (6.5-11.2), respectively. Factors positively associated with treatment duration from 2L were left-sided CRC (HR [95%CI] = 0.71 [0.53-0.96]) and ≥6 months of 1L duration (0.72 [0.56-0.93]); having renal disease (1.92 [1.28-2.88]) or received NSAIDs (1.63 [1.25-2.13]) within 60 days before starting 2L were associated negatively. Conclusions: The real-world data revealed that treatment duration were similar among BEV, RAM and AFL in 2L after EGFRab. Tumor location and 1L duration were associated with the treatment duration from 2L positively, while negative association was observed with renal disease and received NSAIDs. Treatment management was important for treatment continuation.',\n",

       "  '44Background: Despite an alarming rise in incidence, data on survival outcome and treatment response of young-onset (age < 50 years) locally advanced rectal cancer (YO-LARC) patients receiving total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) are sparse. We retrospectively compared the outcome between YO-LARC and later-onset (aged 50 years or older) LARC (LO-LARC) patients treated with TNT. Methods: After the institutional review board approval, electronic medical records of the LARC (T3/T4 or node-positive) patients treated with TNT at a tertiary care cancer center between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2020, were reviewed for data collection. TNT consisted of systemic chemotherapy with oxaliplatin-based regimens for 16 weeks followed by long-course radiation with concurrent capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil (CRT). Patients receiving only preoperative CRT were excluded. Most patients underwent surgical resection following the TNT. Non-operative management was offered to patients if TNT resulted in clinical complete response (cCR). The following comparisons between the YO-LARC and the LO-LARC patients were performed: patient characteristics, pathological complete response (pCR) rate, combined pCR + cCR rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 72 patients included in the analysis, 44(61%) were male, 49 (68%) were Caucasian, and 62 (86%) had clinical stage III disease. The study included 26 (36%) patients with YO-LARC (median age, 43 years) and 46 (64%) patients with LO-LARC (median age, 64 years). The comparison of patient characteristics that included gender, clinical stage, baseline carcinoembryonic antigen level, the distance of the tumor from the anal verge, presence of high-risk features, and histologic grade did not differ significantly between the groups. There were no statistically significant differences in pCR and combined pCR+cCR rates (p = 0.16) between the groups: YO-LARC, 12 % (3/26) and 15 % (4/26), respectively; LO-LARC, 22% (10/46) and 30% (14/46), respectively. Either group did not reach median DFS and OS after a median follow-up of 38 months for survivors. The estimated 5-year OS rates in patients with YO-LARC and LO-LARC were 86 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 69% to 100%) and 84% (95% CI, 68% to 100%), respectively (p = 0.92). The estimated 3-year DFS rates in patients with YO-LARC and LO-LARC were 67 % (95% CI, 50% to 89%) and 83% (95% CI, 72% to 95%), respectively (p = 0.19). Conclusions: The current retrospective analysis did not demonstrate significant differences in the pCR rates, combined pCR +cCR rates, DFS, or OS between the YO-LARC and LO-LARC patients treated with TNT.',\n",

       "  '45Background: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are recognized as strong predictors of cancer prognosis, outcomes, and care. However, racial/ethnic minorities with colorectal cancer (CRC) tend to report poorer general health status (GHS) and mental health status (MHS) compared to non-Hispanic whites. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) if there are racial/ethnic differences in GHS and MHS within 36 months of CRC diagnosis and (2) if poorer GHS and MHS in recently diagnosed CRC patients are associated with mortality. Methods: We used the population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) dataset to analyze Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years who were diagnosed with CRC between 1998 and 2011, received surgical resection for their tumor, and completed a CAHPS survey within 6-36 months post-diagnosis. CAHPS surveys captured patient-reported GHS and MHS on a five-point Likert scale ranging from “poor” to “excellent.” We used stepwise multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between patient race/ethnicity and fair or poor health status, adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors. Additionally, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the risks of mortality associated with fair or poor GHS and MHS. Results: Of 1,867 patients with CRC, 79.5% were non-Hispanic white (NHW), 6.4% were non-Hispanic black (NHB), 7.5% were Hispanic, and 6.6% were non-Hispanic Asian (NHA). In Model 1 of our stepwise logistic regression, NHB patients had higher unadjusted odds for fair or poor GHS (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.28) compared to NHW patients while Hispanic patients had higher unadjusted odds for both fair or poor GHS (1.48, 1.04-2.11) and MHS (1.92, 1.23-3.01). In Model 2, this relationship persisted after adjusting for clinical factors, with NHB patients being more likely to report fair or poor GHS (1.62, 1.10-2.40) and Hispanic patients being more likely to report fair or poor GHS (1.49, 1.04-2.13) and MHS (1.92, 1.22-3.00). In Model 3, after adjusting for both clinical and sociodemographic factors, the association between race/ethnicity and fair or poor GHS (p = 0.53) and MHS (p = 0.23) no longer remained. Reporting fair or poor GHS and MHS was associated with a greater risk of mortality among all CRC patients (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.31-1.76 and 1.62, 1.34-1.99, respectively). Conclusions: Our study illustrates that racial/ethnic differences in PROs are largely driven by sociodemographic factors as opposed to clinical factors. As fair or poor GHS and MHS shortly after diagnosis reflect a higher risk of mortality in CRC patients, efforts to understand unmet biopsychosocial concerns may help further elucidate racial differences in CRC survival that may be otherwise overlooked in standard clinical practice.',\n",

       "  '46Background: Previous studies have suggested age-related shifts in the incidence of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, more contemporary data is needed to further understand the continuous changes in the distribution of mCRC and patient characteristics across different age groups. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted using the Optum Clinformatics database to estimate the incidence rates (IRs) and temporal trends of newly diagnosed mCRC during 2010-2019, stratified by age categories (18-49; 50-64; and 65+). IRs were calculated as the actual patient number of newly diagnosed mCRC divided by the overall enrollment number. The IRs were standardized to the 2010 US population and trends over time were characterized using annual percentage changes (APCs). Results: Total of 23,970 newly diagnosed patients with mCRC were identified during 2010-2019. Median age was 71 years, 65% of patients were white, and 68% of patients had commercial Medicare insurance. Most patients (69%) were 65 years of age or older at the time of mCRC diagnosis. Patients characteristics were similar across age groups, except for race and geographic region. The proportion of Hispanic (12.6%) and Asian (4.7%) mCRC patients was higher in the younger 18-49 group than in the 50-64 (respectively 9.4% and 3%) and 65+ groups (respectively 9.5% and 2.9%). Higher proportions in the 18-49 (44.4%) and 50-64 (47.5%) groups than in the 65+ group (37.6%) were from the South, while higher proportions in the 65+ group were from the West and Northeast (24.4% and 14%). Standardized IRs of mCRC decreased by 22% from 64.4 in 2010 to 50.5 per 100,000 in 2019 among patients 65+, with an APC of -2,11. Standardized IRs increased over the same period by 15% in the 50-64 group, APC = 2.33 and by 22% in the 18-49 age group, APC = 2.8. Conclusions: Temporal changes in mCRC incidence in a large commercially insured population during 2010-2019, showed an increasing trend in younger patients and a decreasing trend in patients 65+. The highest increase in IRs from 2010 to 2019 occurred in the 18-49 age group. Hispanic and Asian patients were more present among the 18-49 than among the older patient groups, and there were geographic differences among the age groups. The changes in age- distribution and evolving patient characteristics need to be considered in the delivery of treatments and care for mCRC.',\n",

       "  '47Background: BRAFmt is a negative prognostic factor in mCRC but also identifies a patient population that may benefit from BRAF targeted therapy. Results from recent trials (BEACON and SWOG1406) demonstrate improved survival outcomes in second- and third-line settings when combining a BRAF inhibitor, an EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi) +/- a MEK inhibitor. In both trials, irinotecan and cetuximab was the control arm with a dismal response rate of 2-4% and progression free survival (PFS) of only 2 months. This suggests chemotherapy plus an EGFRi may not be the optimal approach where BRAF-targeted therapies are not available or have failed. Methods: Data from July 2009 to September 2021 was analysed from TRACC, a multi-site Australian mCRC comprehensive prospective registry enrolling consecutive patients. Patient characteristics, treatment and survival outcomes were examined for patients treated with chemotherapy (CT) alone, with bevacizumab (BEV) or with an EGFRi. Results: Of 2046 registry patients, 256 (13%) harboured a BRAFmt. 72 BRAFmt patients had received second-line (28%) treatment, including CT alone (n = 28), CT plus BEV (n = 26), and CT plus EGFRi (n = 18). Baseline characteristics are shown in the table. Median second-line PFS was 3.3, 4.7 and 1.8 months, for CT alone, CT plus BEV and CT plus EGFRi respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.7, 7.9 and 2.5 months respectively. In multivariate analysis, PFS when treated with CT plus EGFRi trended inferior to CT alone (p = 0.054) and CT plus BEV (p = 0.061), whereas for OS, treatment with CT plus EGFRi was inferior to CT alone (p = 0.038) and CT plus BEV (p = 0.015). Poor PFS was associated with age ≥ 65 years (HR 3.03, p < 0.001) and ECOG ≥ 2 (HR 2.62, p = 0.004), but not associated with a right side primary (p = 0.17), mismatch repair (MMR) status (p = 0.86), or ≥ 3 organs with metastases (p = 0.32). Poor OS was associated with age ≥ 65 years (HR 3.11, p < 0.001), ECOG ≥ 2 (HR 7.32, p < 0.001), right side primary (HR 3.03, p = 0.002) and proficient MMR status (HR 3.57, p = 0.018), but not associated with ≥ 3 organs with metastases (p = 0.17). Conclusions: Less than one-third of BRAFmt mCRC patients received second-line therapy in a real-world setting, indicating an urgency to explore activity of BRAF targeted therapy in the first line setting. Treated patients received limited benefit, with CT plus EGFRi PFS outcomes comparable to BEACON control arm (1.8 vs 2.0 months) and trending inferior to other options.

       "  '48Background: The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin for elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains controversial. Our study could not demonstrate the benefit of adding oxaliplatin for elderly CRC patients aged over 70 years as with the previous clinical trials. Here, we evaluated the prognosis after recurrence in the elderly patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: This retrospective study included patients aged over 70 years who were diagnosed with high-risk stage II and stage III CRC and received adjuvant chemotherapy in our two hospitals (The Jikei University Hospital and Katsushika Medical Center) between January 2010 and December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups; patients who received fluoropyrimidine monotherapy were included in Fp group and those who received fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin were included in Fp+OX group. Moreover, we evaluated patient characteristics, treatment, and survival in the patients with recurrence and compared them between two groups. Results: A total of 127 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy; 75 patients in Fp group and 52 patients in Fp+OX group. With a median follow-up time of 64.5 months, the 5-years disease-free survival and 5-years overall survival in Fp group/Fp+OX group were 70.6/67.1% (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61–1.98) and 89.0/71.8% (HR 1.48, 95% CI 0.76–2.88), respectively. The benefit of adding oxaliplatin was not observed. Among them, 15 patients in Fp group and 14 patients in Fp+OX group were relapsed; median age was 78 (range: 72-83) and 78 (range: 72-86) years, male was 67% and 64%, PS of 0/1 was 67/33% and 86/14%, primary tumor site of right/left was 47/53% and 57/43%, and RAS mutation was 20% and 29%, respectively. Median relapse-free survival was 17.7 and 14.3 months (p = 0.453). There were no significant differences in treatment after recurrence; aggressive treatment (surgery/chemotherapy) was 73% (33/40%) and 86% (21/65%), best supportive care was 7% each, and unknown was 20% and 7%, respectively. However, the median overall survival from the date of relapse was significantly worse in Fp+OX group than Fp group (45.0 and 14.4 months, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Recurrence after receiving adjuvant oxaliplatin combination therapy was considered as one of the poor prognostic factors. It might attenuate the benefit of adding oxaliplatin in adjuvant setting in elderly patients.',\n",

       "  '49Background: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) and regorafenib are among the limited treatment options in later lines of therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). While these treatments have demonstrated similar efficacy, differences have been observed in tolerability and data on the impact of such differences on real-world outcomes are limited. To better understand the real world use of FTD/TPI and regorafenib in the US, we report data for adherence/persistence among patients with CRC initiating these therapies. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study among adults with CRC identified from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases, who initiated FTD/TPI or regorafenib (index) from October 2015-September 2019 and had 6 months of continuous enrollment before the index date. Follow-up was until disenrollment or end of study period. Treatment cohorts were propensity score 1:1 matched, adjusting for differences in socio-demographics, comorbidities, and other baseline characteristics. Adherence and persistence outcomes included time to discontinuation (medication gap of >45 days), medication possession ratio (MPR; number of treated days/ duration of treatment), proportion of days covered (PDC; number of treated days/ days in specified time period), and number of prescriptions received. Results: A total of 1477 patients were included: 892 initiating FTD/TPI (60%) and 585 regorafenib (40%). Demographics were similar prior to matching: mean age was 58 and 59 years, and 57% and 59% were male, in the FTD/TPI and regorafenib groups, respectively. Mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score (excluding cancer) was 0.69 for FTD/TPI initiators and 0.62 for regorafenib initiators. For the matched cohorts (n=585 in each), measures of adherence and persistence (Table) showed longer time to discontinuation (2.5 vs. 2.0 months; p<0.01), and a higher MPR (0.90 vs. 0.87; p<0.01), PDC (at 3 months, 0.74 vs. 0.63; p<0.01), and proportion of patients receiving ≥2 prescriptions (76% vs. 63%; p<0.01) with FTD/TPI vs. regorafenib. Conclusions: Results of this real-world study suggest that patients with CRC initiating FTD/TPI have improved adherence and persistence with therapy compared with those initiating regorafenib. Reasons for this difference and potential impacts on health outcomes require further study.

       "  '50Background: Liver metastatectomy in oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) can result in long-term disease control1. The benefit of resecting LM is unclear, with good survival outcomes from medical therapy (MT) alone and a recent randomised controlled trial failed to demonstrate an overall survival (OS) benefit2. Methods: We examined TRACC (Treatment of Recurrent and Advanced Colorectal Cancer), a multisite registry for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts) from September 2002 – July 2021, focusing on the longer-term outcomes for pts with lung only metastatic disease (LOM). Key clinicopathological, treatment and outcome variables were analysed. Survival outcomes were determined by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 3928 pts, 341 (8.7%) had LOM. The median OS was significantly improved for LOM vs. all mCRC pts (44.5 months vs. 24.8 months, p = <0.0001). Of 341 LOM pts, 142 (42%) had lung resection (LRes),128 (38%) had MT, 71 (20%) best supportive care. Key clinicopathological characteristics are summarised in Table. OS was significantly longer for LRes vs. MT (3yrs-80.1% vs. 41.9%, p = <0.0001, 5 yrs-65.2% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.0001). 10 yr survival for LRes was 50%, with no survivors from MT. The median palliative chemotherapy free interval was 13 months (95% CI 3.1 – 18.7) with recurrence after LRes/death. 20/142 (14%) of the LRes pts had recurrent LRes (median time to repeat resection of 11.4 months, median survival of 66.9 months from repeat LRes). Conclusions: LM from mCRC have an indolent course, with good survival outcomes with MT alone. LRes provides a clinically meaningful palliative chemotherapy free interval and long term survival in selected pts. Significant differences in prognostic factors may have contributed to the observed survival differences between LRes and MT.

       "  '51Background: Understanding the toxicities experienced by patients treated with advanced CRC is critical when considering appropriate dose modifications, standard drug dosing, and quality of life. A workflow that makes available Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) to clinicians to inform overall toxicity assessment should be easy to use and focus on clinically relevant issues. The value of a system that not only collects PRO-CTCAE but integrates it with clinician grading to inform overall symptomatic adverse event assessment during clinical trials is unclear. Methods: Patients were simultaneously enrolled in a phase II multi-center clinical trial that evaluated a genotype-guided dosing strategy for irinotecan by prospectively analyzing efficacy in 100 mCRC patients receiving FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan) and bevacizumab. On day 1 and day 15 of each cycle patients provided PRO-CTCAE responses on 13 symptoms (26 questions) which were made available to clinicians at the time of their toxicity assessment. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Concordance was defined as both patient and clinician giving the same response (both positive or both negative). Results: 100 patients participated in the study, of which 48% were female and 83% White. Overall, 96% of both patients and providers completed at least 80% of PRO-CTCAE forms available to them, demonstrating the feasibility of an integrated workflow for patient-clinician toxicity grading. Across all symptoms, concordance was high (73%) for the patient and provider reporting severe symptoms. 39% of patient-provider pairs reported at least 1 severe symptom and 34% of pairs never reported a severe symptom. In 23% of pairs the patient reported a severe symptom and the provider never did, and in 3% of pairs, the provider reported a severe symptom, but the patient never did. On the symptom level, the concordance was highest (>90%) for dysphagia and vomiting, and lowest (74-82%) for abdominal pain, fatigue, and pain. 52 patients required dose decreases, with the first decrease most often due to hematologic toxicity (80%). In 46% of cases the patient reported at least one severe toxicity prior to or on the same day as the dose decrease, compared to 19% of cases where the provider reported at least severe toxicity prior to or on the same day as the dose decrease. Conclusions: A workflow that brings patient-reported toxicity to clinicians at the time of clinical toxicity rating is feasible. Nevertheless, discordance continues to exist between patient-reported and clinician-reported toxicity ratings, consistent with prior research. Further research could formally compare concordance when using an integrated vs a non-integrated toxicity rating workflow and could ascertain the reasons for continued discordance within an integrated workflow.',\n",

       "  '52Background: The first-line treatments in metastatic colorectal cancer were FOLFOX, CAPOX, FOLFIRI and even FOLFOXIRI as basic chemotherapy regimen combined with targeted therapy. XELIRI regimen was not recommended because of the concerns about the toxicity, efficacy and controversy in optimal dosage. An increasing number of studies indicated promising efficacy with manageable safety profile of dosage and administration-adjusted XELIRI regimen. Therefore, the present study investigated the efficacy, safety and appropriate dosage of mXELIRI regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Methods: The EXIST study was a multicenter, randomized controlled, non-inferiority study and we performed stratification based on the tumor location (left or right side). In the mXELIRI+Bev group, patients received intravenous infusion of irinotecan (a reduced dosage,150mg/m2) with bevacizumab (5mg/kg) on day 1 and oral administration of capecitabine (2000mg/m2/day) tablet on day 1-10/Q14 days. Patients in FOLFIRI+Bev group received intravenous infusion of irinotecan (180mg/m2), calcium folinate (400mg/m2) and 5-Fu (400mg/m2) bolus with bevacizumab (5mg/kg) on day 1 followed by a 46-hour continuous infusion of 5-Fu (2400mg/m2)/Q14 days. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 12 month(PFSR12m) and the secondary endpoints included ORR,OS and safety. Results: 142 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive mXELIRI+Bev (n=76) or FOLIRI+Bev (n=66) in our center between May 2018 and April 2021. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between two groups. In the mXELIRI+Bev group, 70 patients were evaluable with an ORR of 60.0% (1 complete response, CR; 41 partial response, PR; 24 stable disease, SD; 4 progression disease PD). While 57 patients were evaluable in the FOLFIRI+Bev group, with an ORR of 63.2% (36 PR; 15 SD; 6 PD). The PFSR12m for two groups were 32.3% and 21.3%, the median PFS were 9.72 months and 8.77 months, respectively. For safety profiles, no statistical differences were observed in adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression and abnormal liver function. While 10 serious adverse events were recorded in the mXELIRI+Bev group, including intestinal obstruction occurred in 8 patients, intestinal perforation occurred in 1 patients and venous thrombosis occurred in 1 patient. In the FOLIRI+Bev group, intestinal obstruction, venous thrombosis and pulmonary thrombosis was reported in one patient respectively. Conclusions: The modified biweekly XELIRI plus bevacizumab regimen demonstrated promising effect and could be well tolerated based on the data from a single center.

       "  '53Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently presents with concurrent metastasis to the lung and liver. Metastasectomy may offer extended disease control in a select group of patients but its utilization is unknown. We aimed to investigate the trends in utilization of metastasectomy in CRC patients with concurrent lung and liver metastasis and explore its impact on survival. Methods: We queried the National Cancer Database and identified stage 4 CRC patients with concurrent lung and liver metastasis between 2010 – 2016 and categorized them into those that underwent metastasectomy vs. those that did not. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test, and statistically significant factors were included in multivariable logistic regression analysis. In addition, 1:2 propensity score matching was performed, and a multivariable Cox regression model was used to define survival predictors among matched cohorts. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median survival. Results: Out of total 77,719 stage 4 CRC patients, 10,106 (13.0%) patients had concurrent lung and liver metastasis. Six percent (n = 630) of these patients underwent metastasectomy of both sites. Patients that underwent metastasectomy were more likely to be younger (< 50 years; p = 0.009), female (p < 0.001), and White (p = 0.01). These patients were also more likely to have right-sided CRC (p = 0.001) and had resection of the primary site (p < 0.001). Additionally, they were more likely to have private health insurance (p < 0.001) and receive treatment at an academic center (p = 0.03). On adjusted multivariable analysis, female gender, care at an academic center, primary tumor resection and receiving chemotherapy were associated with the metastasectomy group. We did not find a statistically significant difference between comorbidity score, KRAS status and microsatellite status between the 2 groups. In the matched analysis, overall survival (OS) was significantly improved for patients who underwent metastasectomy (23.2 months) vs. those who did not (11.6 months, p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, this difference remained, and metastasectomy was an independent predictor of better OS (HR 0.74 [0.65-0.85], p < 0.001). Conclusions: The utilization of metastasectomy in concurrent lung and liver metastasis is low. It is more frequently used in younger, female and White patients, as well as in patients treated at an academic center. Metastasectomy is independently associated with improved overall survival in patients eligible for such an approach.',\n",

       "  '54Background: KEYNOTE-177 established pembrolizumab as a new standard of care in untreated microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Patients within clinical trials are not always representative of the general population. This underpins the importance of real-world data to offer insights into the outcomes achieved with anti-cancer therapies in routine practice. We report the initial efficacy and safety outcomes of patients treated with pembrolizumab for MSI-H CRC in Scotland. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients with advanced MSI-H CRC treated with pembrolizumab in the Scottish National Health Service was undertaken. Patient demographic and clinico-pathological data were collated via a standardised collection tool. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 28. Results: 39 patients were identified (37 metastatic, 2 with locally advanced unresectable disease). All but 2 patients were treated in the first line setting. The median age was 68 years (range 48-82). 23 (59%) were age ≥65 years. 12 (30.7%) of patients were of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 0, 23 (58.9%) of PS 1 and 4 (10.2%) of PS 2. 21 (53.8%) had BRAF V600E mutations. The median duration of pembrolizumab therapy was 24 weeks (range 2-104). After a median follow-up of 36 weeks (range 3-193), 5 deaths had occurred. The median progression free survival had not been reached. The overall response rate was 51% (20/39 patients), with 1 complete response observed. Radiological disease progression occurred in 7 patients (18%), 6 (86%) of which were BRAF V600E mutant. Treatment failure (radiologically confirmed disease progression or clinical suspicion of progression without radiological confirmation) occurred in 15 patients (38%). 3 out of 4 patients with PS 2 achieved a partial response. There were no grade ≥3 immune related adverse events. There was 1 treatment suspension due to grade 2 immune toxicity but no permanent discontinuations. Conclusions: Our real-world Scottish population was of poorer performance status than those recruited to KEYNOTE-177 (31% PS 0 vs. 49% in KEYNOTE-177). They were also older (59% age ≥65 years vs. 48% in the trial). Patients of PS 2 were excluded from the study, however 3 of our 4 PS 2 patients demonstrated a partial response to treatment, suggesting that PS 2 should not be an absolute contraindication to treatment. Our observed overall response rate was greater than that observed in KEYNOTE-177 (43.8%). Pembrolizumab was safe and well tolerated in this setting. These preliminary findings support the results of KEYNOTE-177. Long term survival data in our population is awaited. Further follow-up and patient numbers will allow for determination of possible clinico-pathological predictors (BRAF and KRAS status, Glasgow Prognostic Score, metastatic burden) of response to immunotherapy in this population.',\n",

       "  '55Background: Tumor shrinkage and disease control with preservation or improvement in quality of life are the primary treatment goals for patients with unresectable mCRC. When not possible, emphasis lies in slowing disease progression and prolonging survival. Advances in mCRC treatment have now improved survival to an average of 30 months in clinical trials. Here, we present initial baseline treatment patterns from the PROMETCO study (NCT03935763), the first international, prospective real-world study to investigate the continuum of care in the mCRC population, collecting data on all patients regardless of treatment. Methods: Enrolment in PROMETCO began in March 2019. On October 1, 2020, systemic treatment characteristics from 277 mCRC patients were analyzed. Adult patients with two disease progressions since the first diagnosis of metastatic disease who were willing to receive subsequent treatment were included. Treatments started prior to study inclusion were analyzed by line and by patients’ molecular status (RAS/BRAF and MSI). Results: In the overall population, first-line treatment data were available for 257 patients. Doublet/triplet chemotherapy (dt/t CT) + anti-VEGF/EGFR therapy was received by 70% (180) of patients, and 20% (51) received dt/t CT alone, in contrast to current guidelines. At second line (n = 209), 68% (142) of patients received dt/t CT + anti-VEGF/EGFR therapy. The proportion of dt/t CT given alone was consistent between first and second line. Median duration of treatment decreased with progressing line of treatment (mirrored in the molecular status subgroups). In the RAS/BRAF patient population, 14% (40) had unknown status at inclusion, 0.7% (2) were RAS/BRAF mutant (mut), and the BRAF mut subgroup had too few numbers from which to draw conclusions. The proportion of patients receiving dt/t CT alone was higher in the RAS mut (23%; 31/135) vs RAS/BRAF WT (12%; 9/76) groups. Dt/t CT + anti-VEGF was received by 64% (87/135) and 21% (16/76) of the RAS mut and RAS/BRAF WT patients, respectively. There were no unexpected results in treatments received between molecular groups at second line, nor in terms of the length of treatment. Fifty percent of the population had unknown MSI status, and MSI low/high groups had too few numbers from which to draw conclusions. The treatment distribution in MSS patients at first line (n = 124) and second line (n = 102) followed a similar trend to the overall population. Conclusions: Preliminary data from PROMETCO provide key insights as to the treatments received by real-world mCRC patients. Further analysis of patients in a larger cohort will be important to better understand discrepancies in treatment choice (ie adherence to guidelines), and country-based differences in testing/reimbursement, which may help elucidate the missing data seen in the molecular-status subgroups.

       "  '56Background: Identification of MSI-H is clinically meaningful in patients with aGI given the associated approval of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors. MSI-H has long been assessed via tissue analysis; and insights from plasma-based approaches are limited to small validation studies. We sought to assess prevalence of initial and acquired MSI-H status across aGI and report real-world outcomes of colorectal (CRC) patients who received ICI after MSI-H identification by a commercially available liquid biopsy (LBx) assay. Methods: Genomic results from a well-validated LBx assay (Guardant360) completed as part of usual clinical care between 10/1/2018-9/7/2021 in patients with aGI were queried to assess MSI-H prevalence and identify cases of potential acquired MSI-H. Real-world evidence (RWE) was sourced from the GuardantINFORM database comprised of aggregated payer claims and de-identified records from 11/1/2018-3/31/2021. Patients with plasma-identified MSI-H who started new therapy < 60 days after assay report date were sorted into treatment groups: chemotherapy +/- biologic therapy (“chemo”) or immunotherapy via pembrolizumab or nivolumab (“ICI”). Real-world time to discontinuation (rwTTD) and real-world time to next treatment (rwTTNT) were assessed as proxies for progression free survival. Log-rank tests were used to assess differences in rwTTD, rwTTNT and overall survival. Results: Prevalence of MSI-H was ̃2% across aGI (Table). Five cases were observed to have potential acquired MSI not attributable to tumor shed identified on serial LBx tests. Of 222 MSI-H CRC patients eligible for RWE analysis, 89(40%) started new therapy within 60 days of results: 42(48%) received ICI, 39(44%) received chemo, 8(9%) received other/mixed regimens. Patients who received ICI had significantly longer rwTTD and rwTTNT compared to patients who received chemo [median months to discontinuation = 7.5 (95% CI 3.4-12.3) vs. 2 (95% 1.4-3.3) p<0.001; median months to next treatment = 23.8 (95% 10.6-NA) vs. 4.5 (95% CI 2.9-NA) p=0.006]; no overall survival difference was observed (p=0.559). Conclusions: This LBx assay detected MSI-H at similar frequencies to published tissue cohorts and may identify acquired MSI-H following early lines of therapy. Patients who received ICI following LBx identification of MSI-H achieved responses in line with published data in previously treated aGI. Well-validated LBx is a viable tool to identify initial and acquired MSI-H in aGI and may expand the number of patients who could benefit from ICI therapy, particularly in cases where access to tissue specimens is not feasible.

As there is no consensus on the prognostic role of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations in mCRC, we assessed the feasibility of using SQL, a programming language, to derive data from routine electronic clinical notes to investigate the prognostic impact of TP53 and PIK3CA mutations in mCRC. Methods: A cohort of patients (pts) diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer as per ICD-10 classification from January 2015 to December 2017 and managed at the Royal Marsden Hospital were identified using SQL algorithms developed in-house. Baseline demographics, histopathological and molecular characteristics and death dates were derived from the Electronic Patient Record and extracted in a structured format for statistical analysis. Mutational analysis of TP53 and PIK3CA were performed with standard of care KRAS, NRAS and BRAF testing using next generation sequencing. Overall survival (OS) according to TP53 or PIK3CA mutational status was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression included KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, sidedness and mismatch repair (MMR) status. Association between TP53 or PIK3CA and MMR status was tested by the Chi squared test. Results: A total of 367 mCRC pts were identified; 10 were excluded due to ineligibility or inadequate data availability. Based on a final dataset of 357 pts, 342 and 354 pts had TP53 and PIK3CA results available. The incidence of TP53 mutations was 75% (n = 257/342) and PIK3CA 16% (n = 55/354). Co-mutations with KRAS, NRAS and BRAF were seen (Table). The overall median follow-up was 42.3 and 42.7 months for TP53 and PIK3CA respectively. There was no difference in OS between TP53 mutant (MT) and wild type (WT) pts (22.0 vs. 22.8 months, p = 0.96) and between PIK3CA MT and WT pts (21.7 vs. 22.4 months, p = 0.49). Right sided and BRAF MT tumours were associated with poorer survival than left sided and BRAF WT tumours when all other factors were constant for TP53 (p<0.001 & p=0.033 respectively) and PIK3CA (both p<0.001) OS on multivariate analysis. MMR deficient tumours were significantly more frequent in TP53 WT compared to TP53 MT tumours (15% vs. 4%, p=0.001) while they were significantly more frequent in PIK3CA MT compared to PIK3CA WT tumours (20% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Bespoke SQL algorithms enables large-scale data extraction to facilitate research. Based on this dataset, we have shown that TP53 and PIK3CA mutations have no prognostic impact in mCRC.

       "  '58Background: Regorafenib and trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) are the only therapeutic options for patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with demonstrated benefit in overall survival (OS). However, they are not accessible worldwide. In Brazil, they have been recently approved, but they have not yet been provided by public health system or private health insurances. We aimed to describe the treatment patterns and clinical outcomes of that population in a setting with limited access to those drugs. Methods: Retrospective study evaluating 510 patients with mCRC who were treated at five Oncoclinicas centers in Brazil from January 2011 to December 2019. Demographic and clinical data were retrieved from electronic medical records. The median OS was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic factors were evaluated via multivariable Cox Regression, calculating the Hazard Ratio (HR) and the confidence interval (CI95%). Results: A total of 163 patients (33% of the overall population) received third-line and 73 (15%) fourth-line systemic therapy. Median age was 62 years, 59% were male. Tumors were right-sided in 19%, RAS mutated 44%, BRAF mutated 3%, and high-frequency microsatellite instability 3%. Metastasectomy prior to third-line was performed in 62% of the patients. From the start of third-line therapy, median follow-up was 9.0 months, with 67% of deaths, and median OS was 13.7 months (CI95% 11.8m–20.0m). Most adopted regimens in third-and fourth-line were (1) rechallenge with oxaliplatin-based therapy (39% and 26%, respectively); (2) rechallenge with irinotecan-based therapy (32% and 34%); (3) rechallenge with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (20% and 29%); (4) regorafenib (13% and 25%); and (5) TAS-102 (2% and 4%). In multivariable model including clinical and molecular variables, prior metastasectomy was the only significant prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.51, CI95% 0.31–0.83, p=0.007). Conclusions: In real-world, a meaningful proportion of patients with mCRC are eligible for third and later lines of therapy. Rechallenge with chemotherapy and anti-EGFR agents is overused in a setting of limited access to therapies with demonstrated OS benefit, such as regorafenib and TAS-102. Barriers to drug access impair the adoption of the best evidence-based continuum of care and strategies to overcome them are urgently needed. Refractory patients in later lines of therapy derive survival benefit from prior metastasectomy.',\n",

       "  '59Background: Over the last decades the incidence of EOCRC (age 50 or less) has dramatically increased, and so has the scientific interest in this field, given that clinical and molecular characteristics in these patients are not well understood, and may be critical to identify prognostic factors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 554 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), analyzing the PFS and OS of 68 (12.25%) patients with EOCRC, as well as their clinical and molecular characteristics. We used a log-rank test to compare PFS and OS, and the estimate of hazard ratio (HR) between the studied groups was calculated by means of Cox proportional hazard model. We also used the exact test of Fisher to identify significant association between categoric variants, while Mann-Whitney test was applied to identify significant differences between numeric values. Results: We performed a survival analysis: those patients with EOCRC had significantly higher median PFS in first line of treatment (16.2 vs. 11.3 months, p = 0.042) and significantly higher median OS (121.5 vs. 58.1 months, p = 0.011). Several characteristics were significantly more frequent in patients with EOCRC (n=68): BMI < 18.5 (n = 16, OR = 1.9, p = 0.046), primary tumor site at transverse colon (n = 9, OR = 2.61, p = 0.03) and ECOG 0 (n = 32, OR = 2.21, p = 0.003). Having peritoneal metastases almost reached statistical signification (n = 17, OR = 1.82, p = 0.055). Some other characteristics were less frequent: BMI 25-30 (n = 13, OR = 0.51, p = 0.046), primary tumor site at sigmoid colon (n = 14, OR = 0.49, p = 0.038) and former-smoker status (n = 7, OR = 0.44, p = 0.048). Moreover, mean values of LDH at diagnosis were significantly higher in EOCRC patients (359 U/L vs. 280 U/L, p = 0.015). EOCRC patients received a significantly higher number of lines of chemotherapy (2.94 vs. 2.38, p = 0.027) and underwent more surgeries (2,42 vs. 1.24, p < 0,001) than patients with > 50 years. Significant differences in tumor mutational status (BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, MSI, PI3K and HER2), sex, primary tumor resection or number of metastatic sites between groups were not found. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis showed that EOCRC patients had significant higher rates of PFS in first-line treatment and OS. Moreover, EOCRC patients had more frequently BMI < 18.5, primary tumor located at transverse colon and ECOG 0.',\n",

       "  '60Background: Several colorectal cancer (CRC) screening options are considered in guidelines for individuals at average-risk (IAR). These options differ in aspects such as invasiveness, recommended frequency, and precision that need to be compared and weighed. This study elicited and compared the relative importance that physicians and IAR place on these screening aspects. Methods: Primary care physicians [PCPs] and gastroenterologists [GIs] who recommended/performed ≥1 screening one month prior to study and adult IAR completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Participants repeatedly chose between screening tests described by type of test, frequency, true-positive (TP), true-negative (TN), and adenoma TP (physicians only). The instrument was tested in qualitative (physicians: n=6; IAR: n=6) and quantitative pilots (physicians: n=100; IAR: n=202). A mixed logit model was used to estimate relative attribute importance (RAI) and predicted choice probabilities for colonoscopy, multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and methylated septin 9 (mSEPT9) blood test. Generalizability to the population was confirmed. Results: 1,249 IAR and 400 physicians participated. IAR were 46% male and the mean age was 58.9. Physicians were 79% male and their mean age was 53.4. Preferences were most affected by TP rates (IAR RAI=58%; physicians RAI=42%). Physicians also placed high importance (RAI=41%) on adenoma TP rates. TN rates (IAR RAI=33%; physician RAI=9%), frequency (IAR RAI=6%; physician RAI=2%) and type (IAR RAI=4%; physician RAI=6%) were less important. Despite both IAR and physicians placing most importance on precision, preferences for screening modalities differed. On average, physicians preferred colonoscopy, while IAR preferred mt-sDNA over colonoscopy (p<0.001). Both preferred mt-sDNA and colonoscopy over FIT (p<0.001), with a mSEPT9 blood test being least preferred (p<0.001). Preferences of IAR were heterogeneous with individuals who underwent colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy screening preferring colonoscopy and the rest preferring mt-sDNA (p<0.001). Conclusions: While both GI and PCPs overwhelmingly preferred colonoscopy, preferences of IAR were heterogenous, with mt-sDNA being preferred on average other modalities. Offering choices in addition to colonoscopy could improve screening uptake.

       "  '62Background: In Kazakhstan colorectal cancer (CRC) occupies the third position in the structure of total oncological incidence and mortality. Kazakhstan is a country with a large territory, with different geographical, industrial characteristics and dietary habits of the population. So CRC prevalence levels vary from region to region: in 2013 the highest regional incidence rate is 6 times higher than the lowest. CRC population screening among men and women aged 50-70 years was started in 2011 in Kazakhstan. Methods: Within 10 years of the screening, 9 532 927 men and women were examined, 3419 CRC cases were detected. Coverage of target population ranged from 78.4% in 2012 to 53.1% in 2020. The analysis of screening indicators was carried out: cancer detection rate, the proportion of 0-1 stages, the ratio to the underlying incidence, the relationship with the dynamics of CRC incidence and mortality. According to the incidence rate in 2011-2020 regions of the country are conditionally divided into three groups: group A – high level (31.04-23.5 per 100 thousand population), group B – medium level (20.5-15.0%ooo), C - low level (11.6- 8.1%ooo). Results: The average annual CRC detection rate for 10 years of screening was 0.4% (4 cancer cases per 1000 examined), in groups A - 0.5%, B - 0.4% and C - 0.3%. The detection ratio of stage 0-I was 0.08%: in groups A - 0.10%, B - 0.09% and C - 0.05%. The average annual incidence rates were in groups A - 27.2 per 100 thousand population, B - 18.7%ooo and C - 9.8%ooo. During time of g-FOBT applying (2011-2013), the average annual incidence rates in the groups were in groups: A - 25.8%ooo, B - 16.4%ooo, C - 8.2%ooo. During time of using FIT (i-FOBT, 2014-2020), the average annual incidence rates increased to 27.0%ooo, 20.0%ooo and 9.9%ooo respectively. The greatest increase in the incidence was noted in groups B and C (22.7% and 22.2%), the smallest in group A (4.7%). Screening increased the CRC incidence from 15.5%ooo in 2011 to 16.5%ooo in 2020 and reduced mortality from 9.3%ooo (2011) to 8.0%ooo (2020). Conclusions: Screening increased the incidence (6.5%) and decreased the mortality from CRC (14%) for 10 years in Kazakhstan. There is a particularly significant effect of screening on the growth of some indicators (incidence and mortality rates, cancer detection rate and early cancer detection) in regions with a low CRC prevalence.',\n",

       "  '63Background: Population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening can reduce mortality by detecting and removing advanced precancerous lesions (APL) and early-stage invasive disease. One guideline-included strategy is the multi-target stool DNA test (mt-sDNA), which combines detection of methylation DNA markers (MDMs), KRAS mutations, and fecal hemoglobin. Since the mt-sDNA pivotal study was conducted, novel biomarkers have been discovered. A panel of highly discriminant MDMs (LASS4, LRRC4, PPP2R5C, and reference marker ZDHHC1) was identified through a blinded, case-control study of archival specimens. Here, we evaluated the performance of this novel mt-sDNA panel, combined with fecal hemoglobin, in archival stool samples weighted to early-stage CRC and prospectively collected APL, simulating a screening population. Methods: The verification study featured 777 samples—210 cases (112 CRC [49 stage I, 38 stage II, 17 stage III, and 8 stage IV] and 98 APL) and 567 controls (176 non-APL and 391 colonoscopy-negative)—from three trials (NCT01397747, NCT01260168, and NCT02503631). Median APL size was 12 mm (interquartile range: 10 mm to 15 mm), with 86.7% adenomas (n = 85) and 13.3% sessile serrated polyps (SSPs; n = 13). The average age was 65.5 years for cases (57% men) and 63.2 for controls (47% men). Samples were processed through homogenization, targeted MDM capture, bisulfite conversion, and MDM quantitation using Long‐probe Quantitative Amplified Signal (LQAS). Fecal hemoglobin was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples were split into stratified 75%/25% training-testing sets and model outcomes were cross-validated 1,000 times. Results: Mean performance from the cross-validation analysis is summarized in the table below. Overall sensitivity was 95.2% for CRC and 57.2% for APL, with specificities of 89.8% (no CRC/APL) and 92.4% (no neoplasia). Subgroup analyses showed high sensitivity for early-stage CRC, with 93.4% at stage I and 94.2% at stage II. By APL subtype, sensitivity was 82.9% for high-grade dysplasia, 73.4% for villous lesions, 49.8% for tubular lesions, and 30.2% for SSPs. Conclusions: These data support high sensitivity and specificity for a second-generation mt-sDNA panel. A multicenter pivotal trial evaluating the panel is underway (NCT04144738).

       "  '64Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has shown to improve early detection and reduce mortality. Despite, the availability of multiple screening tests for CRC, the current screening rates remains below the national goal. The multi-target stool (MTS) DNA test (commercially known as Cologuard) has contributed to an increase in population adherence to CRC screening and is currently recommended by multiple guidelines. Southeastern Kentucky (SE KY) has a high incidence of colorectal cancer and a low rate of CRC screening. The aim of this study is to assess the adherence to the MTSDNA test in rural SE KY. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients 45 and older with a MTSDNA test ordered between August 2020 and February 2021 at a large primary care group in SE KY. All patients had Tests ordered and kits delivered. Cross-sectional adherence was defined as completion and return of the kit within 180 days from test order and was assessed as overall adherence and by patient characteristics including age, sex and healthcare coverage. Results: 450 tests were ordered. 160 (35%) were male and 290 (65%) females. Mean age was 62 with age range (46-87). 207 tests were returned with a cross-sectional adherence of 46%. Adherence was significantly lower for age 45 - 55 at 35.2% (26.2-45.2) compared to age 55 - 65 at 48.9% (40.9-56.3), 65 and older at 50.0% (42.3-57.7) (P = 0.04). Highest adherence with Medicaid coverage 65.4% [44.3-82.8] and lowest in Managed Care Organization (MCO) coverage 34.0% [4.7-44.2] (P < 0.01). Gender was not associated with adherence (P = 0.75). Conclusions: This retrospective study showed that only 46% of patients were adherent to the MTS DNA test for colorectal screening which is significantly lower than previously reported in larger studies and further studies are needed to identify the barriers to non-adherence to this test, especially in the younger population with alarming increase in incidence of CRC. There is impending need to implement different strategies to improve screening adherence.',\n",

       "  '65Background: There is consensus that the proportion of the average-risk US population up-to-date with CRC screening (58-65%) is insufficient. However, estimates of average risk CRC screening rates are inconsistent and impacted by inclusion of higher-risk individuals, and differing study designs. Accurate measurement of population screening rates is key to addressing gaps in care and assessing the impact of newer CRC screening tests. Methods: The study included individuals aged 50-75 years in a large de-identified claims database, with continuous enrollment during year of analysis, and a variable length baseline enrollment of 1-10 years. Average-risk designation excluded higher risk diagnoses (CRC familial syndromes, colorectal polyp or history of colorectal polyp, history of/current CRC, family history of gastrointestinal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease). Up-to-date status was assessed within guideline-based time periods: colonoscopy (10 years); FIT or FOBT (annually); mt-sDNA (3 years); flexible sigmoidoscopy/CT colonography (5 years). Analyses assessed the proportion estimated as up-to-date and examined the sensitivity to: a) patient population (average-risk only vs. including higher-risk); b) study design (yearly cross-sectional vs. cohort of 50-year-old patients; c) methods (percent in patients with 10 years of enrollment vs. Kaplan Meier (KM) of censored variable pre-screening period). Results: The cross-sectional analysis average-risk population included 5.3 million individuals. Estimates of the proportion of those up-to-date with screening guidelines for average-risk patients varied by study design, population, and estimation method. KM estimates among the average-risk population (50-75) showed 49-50% were up-to-date in each calendar year. Including higher-risk patients in the KM analysis resulted in 70% up-to-date among the mixed average+higher-risk population. Using a cohort study design (average-risk patients aged 60 with 10 years of baseline data), 65% were up-to-date by age 60. Conclusions: In the base case analysis only half of average risk individuals were up-to-date with CRC screening, a rate lower than typically cited. Sensitivity analyses resulted in substantially different estimates and demonstrate the importance of clearly communicating the methodology used to define the study population. Higher rates quoted in the lay press and medical publications may be based on mixed populations of average+higher-risk individuals or on study designs that do not represent the full population at risk.',\n",

       "  '66Background: Poor dietary patterns are clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of CRC and are increasingly associated with worsened CRC outcomes, including a higher risk of cancer recurrence and mortality. We evaluated the use of a novel computerized FFQ technology to assess dietary patterns in patients with CRC who were undergoing cancer surveillance. Methods: We recruited patients with stage I-III CRC who had completed curative intent therapy at least 1 year but no more than 5 years prior to enrollment. Dietary assessment was conducted using a computerized FFQ (VioScreen) either in clinic or at home. Dietary quality was defined by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2015 score which was calculated automatically by the FFQ technology. Statistical significance was determined using Pearson correlation and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Twenty patients (14 colon, 6 rectal; 12 male, 8 female; median age 66 [49-80]; median 3 years from diagnosis) were recruited between 10/2020-9/2021. Fourteen patients did FFQ remotely and 6 in-person. Nineteen patients were white/non-Hispanic. All received surgery, 20% radiation (all rectal) and 75% chemotherapy. Mean HEI 2015 total and sub-scores are shown in the table. There were significant differences in dietary quality by age <65 vs ≥65 (HEI 58.3 vs. 72.6, p=0.025), body-mass-index (BMI) normal/overweight vs. obese (HEI 72.4 vs. 58.6, p=0.033), and marital status of married vs non-married (HEI 61.7 vs. 76.7, p=0.032). There were no differences in dietary quality by level of education, tumor site (colon vs. rectal) or gender. There was a significant negative correlation with increased time since diagnosis and lower dietary quality (r= -0.67, p<0.001). Conclusions: Dietary patterns can be determined using a computerized FFQ in patients with CRC on surveillance both remotely and in-person. This population has a wide range of dietary patterns with particularly low scores in whole grain, fatty acid, sodium and saturated fat. Patients who are older, non-obese, non-married, and closer to completion of cancer therapy have higher dietary quality scores. Future studies of integrating a computerized FFQ into cancer care will determine whether personalized interventions targeting specific dietary patterns can improve diet quality.HEI Component (Max Score)Average Score (range)Adequacy:· Total Fruits (5)3.4 (0.2-5)· Whole Fruits (5)3.9 (0.5-5)· Total Vegetables (5)4.0 (1.8-5)· Greens and Beans (5)3.5 (0.3-5)· Whole Grains (10)4.5 (0.9-10)· Dairy (10)6.2 (0.5-10)· Total Protein Foods (5)4.7 (1.1-5)· Seafood and Plant Proteins (5)4.4 (0.1-5)· Fatty Acids (10)5.2 (1.4-10)Moderation (reduced consumption leads to higher score):· Refined Grains (10)8.6 (3.5-10)· Sodium (10)4.1 (0-9.4)· Saturated Fats (10)5.3 (0-10)· Added Sugars (10)8.5 (0-10)Total Score (100)66.2 (42.5-84.8)',\n",

       "  '67Background: in Mexico, Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death, yet population-based screening programs are lacking. In our center, a cohort was created to validate a risk calculator to detect advanced colorectal neoplasia, and to understand barriers to implement a CRC screening program. We aimed to determine frequency and reasons associated to rejection of CRC screening in our population. Methods: from August 2019 to March 2020 (early close owing to COVID-19 pandemic) asymptomatic individuals between 50 and 75 years-old with standard-risk for CRC, without previous screening for CRC, from the outpatient internal medicine clinic at a tertiary care center in Mexico City, received standardized information on the importance of CRC screening and were invited to perform both Fecal Immunochemical Test and a screening colonoscopy within a clinical study at no cost. Individuals who rejected participation were given a 10-item questionnaire to select reasons for refusal, as many items as applied. Here we present two groups: 1) individuals who refused to receive information and to perform screening studies, and 2) individuals who refused to participate after receiving information. Results: 162 patients were invited to participate, 77 (47%) refused: 48 rejected immediately (group 1) and provided 51 reasons, and 29 declined after having received standardized information about CRC screening (group 2) and provided 30 reasons. Demographics for 77 patients were: 54 (70.1%) women, median age 66 (IQR 58-71) years. Main reasons for rejection in both groups were: “I do not have time” in 24 (29.6%) times, “I am not interested” in 23 (28.4%) times, and “I am scared” in 14 (17.3%) times (Table). Conclusions: in our cohort, we identified that nearly half of the population invited to participate in a CRC screening program refused. Main reasons were lack of time, lack of interest and fear. This may translate poor understanding on the importance of measures to prevent CRC, and absence of education programs to recall its importance. In order to increment participation in CRC screening, education and awareness campaigns should be implemented.Reasons for CRC screening refusal before and after receiving standardized information.ReasonsGroup 1Immediate refusal n=51n (%)Group 2Post-information refusaln=30 n (%)I do not have time15 (29.4)9 (30)I am not interested17 (33.3)6 (20)I am scared8 (15.6)6 (20)I am healthy4 (7.5)1 (3.3)I prefer not to answer2 (3.9)2 (6.7)Other*5 (9.9)6 (20)Data is shown as the number of times an option was selected, not the number of patients.* Includes: difficulty with transportation, long distance from home, economic issues.',\n",

       "  '68Background: With the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the number of uninsured patients in states that expanded Medicaid decreased more among racial/ethnic minorities and lower income adults. Increased access to care could influence colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence through increased screening. However, we lack research on whether Medicaid expansion differentially influenced CRC incidence among vulnerable patient subgroups. This population-based study examines whether Medicaid expansion with the ACA was associated with decreased CRC incidence among racial/ethnic minorities, and adults with lower income. Methods: We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database to calculate the age-adjusted incidence rates of CRC among patients under 65 years of age diagnosed between 2010 and 2018. We categorized states into two groups: states that expanded Medicaid on January 1, 2014, and states that did not expand Medicaid over the study period. We determined the change in CRC incidence before Medicaid expansion (2010-2013) and after Medicaid expansion (2014-2018). We used a difference-in-difference approach to determine whether changes in CRC incidence differed by expansion status among all patients and among subgroups stratified by race/ethnicity and other socioeconomic indicators. Results: Among the entire study cohort, from 2010-2013 to 2014-2018, rates of CRC (per 100,000) increased from 26.6 to 28.3, and this increasing rate did not differ by ACA expansion status (p=0.48). We found that the impact of ACA expansion on CRC incidence varied by race/ethnicity. The increase in CRC rates was higher among non-ACA expansion states compared to ACA expansion states for Hispanics (5.4 vs. 1.6 increase per 100,000; p=0.002), and Asian or Pacific Islanders (4.3 vs. 0.4 increase per 100,000; p=0.02), but not with Black (p=0.94), or non-Hispanic white patients (p=0.91). The change in CRC incidence between 2010-2013 and 2014-2018 did not differ by county-level household income, fraction under the federal poverty level, or education level (all p>0.05). Conclusions: This study found that Medicaid expansion through the ACA might differentially benefit Hispanic and Asian patients with respect to decreases in CRC incidence. This study reports on the first 5 years after the ACA, though the true benefits of increased access to care may take longer to manifest. Additional research with longer follow-up is required to fully understand the influence of Medicaid expansion.',\n",

       "  '69Background: Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most frequent hereditary cancer syndrome among patients with colorectal cancer. Screening tests such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and PREMM5 model help to identify patients at risk of germline pathogenic variants (PVs). However, there has been a disparity in that evaluation of these screening tools and their correlation with pathogenic variants (PVs) has been limited in Hispanic populations. Methods: Patients with colorectal cancer referred for genetic cancer risk assessment were enrolled in the Clinical Cancer Genomics Community Research Network (CCGCRN) registry from October 2017 to February 2021 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán. Genetic testing was performed by full sequencing of the MMR genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 and EPCAM) and other cancer-associated genes (APC, BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, NF1, ATM, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1) and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to detect copy number variants (CNV) was performed for selected genes. Demographic, clinical characteristics and IHC results were obtained from clinical records. MMR PV probability was calculated using PREMM5. Results: Sixty-nine patients with colorectal cancer were included; mean age at diagnosis was 50 (26-82) years and 39/69 (56%) were women. A MMR gene PV was identified in 23/69 patients (33%); most frequently in MLH1 n = 14, followed by MSH2 n = 2, MSH6 n = 2 and PMS2 n = 1. Four recurrent PVs in MLH1 and MSH2 represented 22% of PVs. CNVs were identified in 4/23 (17.4%) patients with LS. PVs in other genes were identified in 8.6% of the cases: 2 ATM, 1 APC, 1 PALB2, 1 BRIP1 and 1 BRCA1. IHC results were available in 52/69 cases (75.4%) and MMR protein deficiency was found in 16/17 (94%) carriers and in 14/31 (45%) non-carriers (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 54.8%). The area under the ROC curve for PREMM5 score was 0.94 (95% CI 0.88-0.99) with a mean score 31.6 (2.4-50) in patients with LS and 4.1 (0.9-50) in non-carriers. The diagnosis of a second primary colon cancer was more frequent among LS (30% vs 2.5%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: We found a high frequency of MMR gene PVs among patients referred for GCRA with personal history of colon cancer, and only a small proportion with PVs in other genes. Our results showed a good performance of PREMM5 model and a high sensitivity of MMR IHQ in a Mexican population, indicating that these are tools that can be used to prioritize patient selection for germline testing.',\n",

       "  '70Background: In the US, pts living in rural areas have higher CRC mortality rates than urban areas. Clinical guidelines recommend testing for BRAF and RAS mutations and deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability in pts with mCRC. However, data on biomarker testing rates in rural communities compared with urban areas are limited. We surveyed ONC in the US who practice in rural areas or urban clusters to identify biomarker testing patterns and barriers (data previously reported) and conducted interviews with a select group of respondents to further understand key differences that may contribute to substandard biomarker testing rates in rural areas. Methods: A 2-part (quantitative and qualitative) survey was conducted with ONC who spend > 40% of their time providing direct care to pts in rural areas or urban clusters and who had treated ≥2 pts with stage IV mCRC in the month prior to the survey. After screening, a subset of those who completed the quantitative survey participated in the qualitative survey (a 30-minute, web-assisted, telephone interview). The interview questions targeted 6 areas: clinical practice description, biomarker and genomic testing patterns, pathology and molecular tumor board, tumor tissue journey, electronic health records, and training/educational opportunities. Results: Of the 99 ONC who responded to the quantitative survey, 17 were interviewed for the qualitative survey from June 16–29, 2021. A key finding of the quantitative survey was that although ONC reported being familiar with biomarkers relevant to mCRC, the reported rate of biomarker testing was suboptimal. The interviews probed reasons why testing does not align with current guidelines and found that challenges exist throughout the tumor tissue journey including insufficient tumor tissue available for testing (especially in the relapsed/refractory setting); lack of or limited protocols, clinical decision support systems, reflexive testing, and molecular tumor boards; lengthy and difficult-to-navigate next-generation sequencing reports; and financial toxicity surrounding biomarker tests (especially for underinsured pts), among other barriers. Despite these challenges, ONC reported easy access to third-party reference labs and electronic references, such as NCCN and UpToDate. Although telehealth visits have nearly quadrupled during the COVID pandemic, access to telehealth may be limited for pts living in rural areas or urban clusters. Conclusions: The ONC surveyed reported that practicing in rural/urban clusters poses unique challenges related to tissue acquisition, practice resources, pts’ ability to pay, and clinical knowledge gaps that may affect biomarker testing rates in pts with mCRC. Addressing these gaps is warranted if optimal utilization of precision medicine tools is to be realized.',\n",

Characterizing the distinct unmet needs of YA CRC survivors is important given their unique cancer experience which may include an ostomy, chronic bowel symptoms, and functional deficits. The purpose of this study was to examine CRC survivors’ unmet needs across general, clinical, and psychosocial domains. Methods: An online, cross-sectional survey was administered via Facebook in collaboration with a national YA CRC patient advocacy organization. Respondents (diagnosed 18-39) endorsed areas in which they required more information on aspects of their lives that may have been affected by their cancer experience. Needs were stratified by life stage (emerging [18-29 years] and young [30-39] adulthood). Results: Respondents (n=189) were colon (40.2%) and rectal (59.8%) cancer survivors with a mean current age of 32.2 years (SD=4.6) and a mean age of 30.2 years (SD=4.3) at diagnosis. Most endorsed items per domain included: nutrition and diet (52.1%), complementary and alternative treatments (45.4%), and talking about your cancer experience with family, friends, and co-workers (36.1%). Survivors in emerging adulthood (n=80), compared with those in young adulthood (n=109), endorsed notably greater needs in: staying physically fit (57.5% versus 38.5%), complementary and alternative treatments (57.5% versus 36.7%), and advice/help about dating and intimate relationships (18.8% versus 6.4%). Conclusions: Overall, half of respondents endorsed a desire for information on nutrition and diet, staying physically fit, and complementary and alternative treatments. Differing endorsement rates by age group indicate the importance of tailored approaches. Optimal counseling, resources, and referrals specific to life stage can mitigate the unmet needs of YA CRC survivors to improve health outcomes and quality of life.

       "  '72Background: Fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy is a mainstay of the adjuvant and palliative management of colorectal cancer. Cardiac toxicities—including angina, myocardial infarction and arrhythmias—are uncommon complications thought to be mediated by coronary vasospasm. Although potentially life-threatening, they remain poorly described and consensus guidelines regarding patient selection are lacking. To assess current understanding of this toxicity, we performed a literature review of the topic. We then evaluated fluoropyrimidine use at a large UK cancer center to investigate current practice. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched to March 1 2021 using the search terms (fluorouracil OR capecitabine) AND—separately—cardiotoxicity, heart disease, and rechallenge*. Original research articles in English were included and their findings summarised. The case notes of all patients who underwent surgery for pathological stage III colon cancer between January 1 2017 and December 31 2019 at Leeds Cancer Centre were reviewed. The proportion of patients who experienced cardiac toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy was assessed. The proportion of patients who were not offered adjuvant chemotherapy due to cardiac risk was identified. Results: The three search strategies identified 582, 55 and 21 citations respectively, of which 28, 7 and 7 full texts were retrieved for further evaluation following review of titles and abstracts. The reported incidence of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity varied widely, as did its definition. Over half of toxicity cases described were ischaemic. Reported risk factors included those for coronary artery disease, although this was not a consistent finding. 125 patients underwent surgery for stage III colon cancer in the study period of whom 81 (65%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. 2 (2.5%) patients failed to complete adjuvant treatment due to cardiac toxicity (angina; cardiac arrest). Pre-existing cardiovascular disease was cited as a reason for not offering adjuvant chemotherapy in 13 of 44 cases (30%). Conclusions: Review of the literature revealed a poor evidence base to guide treatment decisions regarding fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy and cardiac risk. Rates of cardiac toxicity at our center were within expected limits. A number of patients were denied adjuvant chemotherapy due to perceived cardiac risk. A clearer understanding of the pathophysiology and management of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity is urgently required to avoid unnecessarily denying patients effective anti-cancer therapy.',\n",

       "  \"73Background: NGS testing allows for identification of genetic mutations/alterations that can be important in determining treatment options for advanced cancer pts. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) includes NGS testing as part of standard of care for many tumor types including stage IV pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer and all other GI solid tumor types. Previous reports have described the utilization of NGS in clinical practice at academic centers. To our knowledge this is the first report in the private practice setting. Methods: For the historical portion, we established baseline data to quantify NGS testing frequency in stage IV GI tumor pts in our community based oncology practice by performing a retrospective chart review. In the prospective portion, the intervention of an ERN was used to alert treating physicians if NGS had not been done. Primary endpoint is the percent (%) of pts with NGS sent compared to historical control. Secondary endpoint is the % of pts with targeted therapy options made available to them. Results: In a private practice multi-office setting, 200 charts of pts with stage IV GI cancer using Flatiron’s OncoEMR software were reviewed for the retrospective cohort between July 1 to December 31, 2020. Of the 200, 44.5% (89 pts) had colon cancer, 17.5% (35 pts) had pancreatic cancer, 15% (30 pts) had rectal cancer, and 23% (46 pts) had other types of GI cancer. Of these, 87 (43.5%) pts had NGS testing; of which 41 of 89 (46.0%) are colon pts, 13 of 35 (37.1%) are pancreatic pts and 16 of 30 (53.3%) are rectal pts. For the prospective portion, between July 1 and August 15, 2021 each physician’s schedule was evaluated and an ERN was sent shortly before each Stage IV GI pt was to be seen. A total of 114 pts were reviewed, and 92 (79%) had NGS sent. Of these, 47 pts of 54 (87%) are colon pts, 12 of 15 (80%) are pancreatic pts, 16 of 21(76%) are rectal pts, and 17 of 24 (70%) are pts with other GI cancer. 2% of pts with NGS testing had a potentially actionable mutation identified. Conclusions: NGS testing is standard of care for pts with stage IV GI cancer that wish to pursue therapy. ERN was minimally helpful in increasing NGS testing. This may be in part due to the effect of the practice's emphasis on NGS testing, which increased its baseline prospective testing rate. Increased use of a team based approach in the office would be a key element to increasing compliance with the current workflow as well as use of pathways which embed the NGS testing into the treatment plan. A more robust EMR would also be vital in increasing NGS testing rates by the use of automatic reminders or order sets. Better support of the physician and use of multiple touch points is necessary until full automation is utilized for NGS testing.\",\n",

More research is needed to fully understand the challenges caregivers face and to provide solutions. Previous studies have found that caregivers experience high levels of depression and anxiety, and many lack access to resources despite the evidenced need for support. Methods: A survey was disseminated via the Colorectal Cancer Alliance’s Blue Hope Nation community for two weeks and by email. Forty caregivers of colorectal cancer patients of varying stages and diverse demographic backgrounds completed the survey. Results: Half of the respondents have been providing care for 1-3 years, and 63% indicated they were a patient’s spouse or partner. Most caregivers were in the 35-40 age group, and 30% were full-time caregivers. A majority reported experiencing anxiety/stress (97.5%), fatigue (80%), poor sleep (77.5%), depression (75%), and feelings of isolation (72.5%). Primary caregiver activities included providing moral support, completing household chores, and researching treatment options. Only 32.5% of caregivers received help or advice from their patient’s doctors or medical team on the tasks listed. The survey results suggest the need for a comprehensive resource with information on medications, side effects and treatments; a guide for medical discussions; organization for medical forms and documents; and a tool to connect with peer caregivers. Conclusions: Survey themes indicate that caregivers often feel unprepared to provide care, have inadequate knowledge, and receive little guidance from health care providers, so there is continued need to place both the patient and caregiver at the center of care. A comprehensive centralized resource given at diagnosis with vital information and a method for document organization would help reduce caregivers’ stress and allow them to share information easily. Such patient and caregiver-directed resources would enable a better quality of care experience, and potentially better mental health outcomes, for patients and their caregivers.',\n",

       "  '75Background: The factors associated with the rise of young-onset colorectal cancer (YOCRC) remain unclear. In addition to hereditary factors, environmental exposures are believed to be associated with YOCRC. Therefore, we aimed to study the association between the national level Environmental Quality Index (EQI) and YOCRC in the US. Methods: We used the SEER database to select the CRC patients diagnosed between 2010-2016. YOCRC was defined based on age at diagnosis < 50 years. EQI (2005-2010) is a measure of county-level cumulative environmental exposures that includes 5 domains: sociodemographic, built, air, land, and water. A higher value represents a lower environmental quality. We distributed the total EQI and each EQI domain into five quintiles. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between YOCRC and quintiles (upper-most vs. lowest) of EQI after adjusting by race (White, Black, and Others), gender, and stage at diagnosis. The age-adjusted incidence rate was also calculated using the SEER*Stat, and correlation efficiency was estimated between EQI domains and incidence rate. Results: A total of 261,417 CRC patients were included; 11% were YOCRC. In the adjusted multivariable analysis, poor built EQI (OR 1.15 [1.11-1.20]) and water EQI (OR 1.08 [1.03-1.12]) were more likely to be associated with YOCRC. Poor built EQI was more strongly associated with Black YOCRC (OR 1.21 [1.09-1.35]) as compared to White YOCRC (OR 1.14 [1.09-1.19]). Poor sociodemographic EQI was more strongly associated with Others (OR 1.47 [1.25-1.72]) compared to Black YOCRC (OR 1.14 [1.03-1.25]). In addition, poor built EQI (OR 1.19 [1.12-1.27]) and water EQI (OR 1.12 [1.05-1.19]) were more strongly associated with the metastatic disease among YOCRC patients. However, the total poor EQI was not associated with YOCRC (OR 0.99 [0.95-1.03]). On incidence analysis, there was a positive correlation between the incidence rate of YOCRC and sociodemographic EQI (rho=0.49, p<0.001), air EQI (rho=0.30, p<0.001), and land EQI (rho=0.18, p<0.001). Conclusions: This study evaluated a population-based ecological approach and showed that YOCRC was associated with lower environmental quality, including built and water domains. EQI domains were also associated with different racial groups among YOCRC.

       "  '76Background: Chemotherapy and targeted therapies are associated with GI toxicities including diarrhea that affects 50% to 80% of patients. Severe complications include dehydration, malnutrition, fatigue, renal insufficiency, and systemic infection. There are no specific prevention strategies, and treatment options are limited. Dose reduction or interruption of anti-cancer medications may lead to decreased efficacy. This survey was conducted to assess current toxicity management patterns and gaps for cancer therapy-associated diarrhea. Methods: An online survey (MedSurvey) with 6 eligibility & 15 practice questions was conducted (April 27 to 30, 2021). Fifty (50) practicing oncologists completed the survey. Results: Among the 50 oncologists,82% have been practicing ≥ 11 years with 24% from an academic setting and 76% from a community setting. They (percent of respondents) prescribed the following anti-cancer medications more than 10 times per week: cytotoxic chemotherapy (86%), targeted agents (78%), and immuno-oncology therapies (80%). Prevention of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) with Imodium (loperamide) and Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine) were commonly administered (10% always, 60% sometimes) as prophylactic treatment prior to the start of chemotherapy. The majority (60%) would prophylactically use a novel agent for a patient with previous CID, and 38% would use this agent for selected anti-cancer therapies. Many oncologists (5% always, 60% sometimes) start chemotherapy at a lower dose and titrate up to prevent CID. Similar treatment patterns were observed for targeted therapy induced diarrhea (TTID). For Grade 1 CID (multiple choices allowed), 18% used observation only for management, whereas 72% prescribed Imodium, and 22% used Lomotil. For Grade 1 TTID (multiple choices allowed), 26% used observation only, 58% prescribed Imodium, and 26% used Lomotil. Dose reduction was implemented 10% and 6% of the time for CID and TTID, respectively. For Grade 2 CID (multiple choices allowed) 4% used observation only, most started either Imodium (82%) or Lomotil (72%), and 34% considered dose reduction as a treatment strategy. For Imodium or Lomotil non-responders, 50% would dose reduce, and 44% would use an alternate anti-diarrheal treatment (e.g., octreotide). TTID had similar treatment patterns. For immune-oncology agents (e.g., ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab) 40% suggested induced GI toxicities (e.g., diarrhea/colitis) require an innovation for managing toxicity. Conclusions: Treating cancer therapy-associated diarrhea continues to be a significant challenge with Grade 2/3 often requiring a therapeutic dose reduction or interruption that may impact the efficacy of cancer treatment. Effective management (prevention and treatment) for GI toxicity remains an unmet need for many patients.',\n",

       "  '77Background: 5-fluorouracil has been used in treatment of gastrointestinal cancers for more than 40 years. Numerous toxicities of 5-FU are known. Little is known about the occurrence, natural course and causes of oral mucositis (OM) of 5-FU in GI tumors. There is little data on the additional toxicity of VEGF and EGFR antibodies together with 5-FU. We followed the occurrence, severity and localization of OM of 5-FU in consecutive patients as part of their cancer treatment. The primary aim of the study was to determine the severity, course and risk factors of OM up to the first six cycles of ctx. OM was evaluated by repeated inspections of the oral cavity and patient questionnaires. Methods: Pts who received 5-FU for the first time or who had not received ctx for at least 12 months. 64 consecutive pts were included in the observational study from March 2018 to March 2019. Out of 64 pts a total of 41 (28 m/13f) had complete documentations (inspections of the oral cavity and questionnaires) and were available for the evaluation. Results: Mean age 65 ys (range 42-83), 60% were treated for CRC, 22% esophageal/gastric cancer, and 18% other GI-cancers. 13 were non-smokers, 25 former smokers; 7 pts had daily alcohol consumption while 7 pts never consumed alcohol. 10/41 pts wore a dental prosthesis. The mean BMI was 26.5 (range 18.8-41.5). Initial very good/ good oral hygiene was given in 3/20 patients. 80% of the pts developed xerostomia after the first cycle, almost every patient needed support for symptoms due to oral problems during ctx. Of 41 pts, an OM could be documented in 38 pts. A total of 93% of the patients developed a mild course of the mucositis with grade 1-2. OM developed between the 2nd and 3rd cyle in the majority of pts. At the third cyle, only 8 pts had OM of grade 0, while 23 pts had grade 1 and 9 pts were grade 2. It was of note here that of these 9 pts with grade 2, 6 had grade 0 in the 2nd cycle. During cycle 5 and 6 only seven pts had a CTC score of 0, but no pat developed a CTC 3 or 4 OM. We could not document a connection between the occurrence of oral mucositis and the oral hygiene measures used, as no severe course of OM CTC Grad 3 or 4 could be detected. We could not find any relation to the type of 5-FU therapy (doublet, triplet +/- monoclonal antibodies). Conclusions: The incidence of oral mucositis with CTC score of 1 and 2 was 93%, but serious grade 3 and 4 mucositis rates were not observed. Xerostomia was observed in 80% after the first course of treatment. Symptomatic mucositis occurs early within 4 weeks after starting chemotherapy. Local measures appear suitable for symptom control of OM.',\n",

       "  '78Background: Adjuvant oxaliplatin improves colorectal cancer (CRC) survival but causes dose-dependent peripheral neuropathy, possibly increasing the risk of fall-related injuries (FRI) such as fractures. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the impact of adjuvant oxaliplatin cycles on FRIs. Methods: All data were ascertained from linked health administrative and population databases. We included Ontarians aged 18-85 years at CRC diagnosis between January 1 2007 to December 31 2018 who underwent curative resection and received adjuvant oxaliplatin. We excluded those with a prior cancer diagnosis within 5 years, prior CRC diagnosis ever, non-adenocarcinoma histology, prior oxaliplatin, and <2 years of Ontario health insurance prior to CRC diagnosis. Oxaliplatin dose was determined in the 382 days after resection and dichotomized (1-6 vs. 7-12 cycles). The outcome was FRI, defined by ICD10 codes W00-W19 for any injury caused by a fall requiring emergency or inpatient care. Follow-up began at the end of the treatment window and terminated at the first of FRI, death, loss of Ontario health insurance, or March 31 2020. To account for differences between groups, clinical and demographic characteristics at diagnosis (Table) were used to estimate propensity scores for treatment and calculate inverse probability of treatment weights. These weights were applied to a Fine & Gray regression model to determine the subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) estimating the association between FRI and 1-6 versus 7-12 cycles of oxaliplatin, with death as a competing risk. Standardized differences <0.1 indicated negligible imbalance. An interaction term tested for effect modification by age at diagnosis. Results: 9,324 patients were included in the study; 1,870 received 1-6 cycles and 7,454 received 7-12 cycles of oxaliplatin. Those exposed to 1-6 cycles were older (61.0 vs. 59.1 years), had higher comorbidity scores (13.5 vs 12.3), and more often had rectal cancer (27.5 vs. 22.2%). Negligible imbalance remained after weighting. Median follow-up was 50.2 months. Total follow-up was 44,472 person-years. There were 1,223 FRIs and 1,913 deaths. The sHR for FRIs comparing 7-12 cycles against 1-6 cycles of oxaliplatin was 0.98 (95% CI 0.85-1.14). The interaction p-value for age and oxaliplatin dose was 0.24. Conclusions: In this population-based retrospective cohort study of 9,324 patients with CRC, the risk of FRIs was similar for 7-12 cycles compared with 1-6 cycles of adjuvant oxaliplatin. This finding was consistent across age at diagnosis. Future research should examine the relationship between oxaliplatin dose and falls not resulting in injury.

       "  '79Background: Chemotherapy with panitumumab is expected to be well tolerated and improve survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, skin toxicities are its most common adverse events. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment with clarithromycin (CAM) to prevent panitumumab skin toxicities. Methods: We conducted a phase lll, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial on mCRC patients treated with pani- tumumab. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pre-emptive antibiotic and control groups. In the pre-emptive group, CAM administration (200 mg twice per day) continued daily through the panitumumab treatment period. The control regimen consisted of skin care only. The primary end point was the incidence of grade ≥ 2 skin toxicities during the 6-week skin treatment period. Results: Of 156 enrolled patients, 78 received pre-emptive antibiotic treatment, and 78 received reactive treatment. The number and incidence of grade ≥ 2 skin toxicities during the 6-week skin treatment period were 16 (21.3%) and 41 (54.7%) for the pre-emptive and control groups, respectively (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17–0.56). There was almost no difference in the rate of other adverse events between the two groups, but the incidence of grade ≥ 3 diarrhea in the pre-emptive group was high, at 8% vs. 1.3% in the control group. There were no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: Prophylactic oral CAM together with relatively simple skin care was found to be effective in suppressing the development of grade ≥ 2 skin toxicities induced by panitumumab.

       "  '80Background: Higher baseline body mass index is associated with improved survival in metastatic CRC (mCRC). Whether weight gain or loss after mCRC diagnosis is associated with survival remains largely unknown. Methods: We analyzed individual patient data from 3504 patients with previously untreated mCRC enrolled in five phase III randomized trials (AVF2017g, AVF2192g, CRYSTAL, N9741, OPUS) conducted between 2000 and 2006. Weight measurements were prospectively collected at 3 months after diagnosis and then up to 5 years. Patients were categorized into three groups based on the percent weight change at 3 months: stable weight or gain, weight loss up to 5% of baseline weight, and ≥5% weight loss of baseline weight. Cox models were used to assess the prognostic associations of weight change at 3 months with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), adjusting for baseline BMI, age, sex, performance score, chemotherapy backbone (oxaliplatin vs. irinotecan), and biologics type (cetuximab vs. bevacizumab). Sub-analyses included Cox models adjusted for additional clinical-pathological factors (primary tumor sidedness [right colon vs. left colon-rectum], and BRAF status; N=1,511). Results: Median percent weight change at 3 months was -0.5% (IQR -4.0 to+1.6%). OS was better in patients with weight stability or gain than in those with weight loss (up to 5% or ≥5%; (Table). Results were consistent for PFS for patients with ≥5% weight loss of baseline weight, as well as for sub-analyses. Conclusions: Patients losing weight during the first 3 months of systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer have significantly shorter overall survival than those with stable or increasing weight. Degree of weight loss is proportional to the observed increased risk of death and remains evident among underweight, normal weight and obese individuals. Further studies examining possible usefulness of on-treatment early weight loss as a novel intermediary end-point are needed.Weight Change (at 3 months)Events/NAdjusted Median OS (in months)Adjusted Hazard Ratio (95% confidence interval)Adjusted P-valueStable weight or gain723/98123.5Refweight loss up to 5% of baseline weight942/129520.71.21 (1.09-1.34)p<0.001≥5%weight loss of baseline weight473/56314.51.96 (1.74-2.22)p<0.001',\n",

       "  '81Background: Patients undergoing adjuvant treatment with FOLFOX for colorectal cancer (CRC) are at risk of developing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). We assessed survival outcomes in patients who develop CIN in this setting. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with CRC treated with FOLFOX at our institution in Canada from 2013 to 2015. The survival follow-up cut-off date was August 2021. Demographic, treatment, and outcome data were collected. CIN was defined as ANC <1.5, and all episodes of neutropenia were assumed to be the result of chemotherapy. Median OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates. Results: A total of 302 patients were included (baseline demographics in the table). Median follow-up was 110 months. In the overall cohort, 174 patients (58%) had at least one episode of CIN. CIN occurred in 56% of those with stage II cancer, 43% of those with low risk stage III cancer (T1-3 and N1), and 45% of those with high risk stage III cancer (T4 or N2). Median time to first CIN event was 4.3 months. Among patients with at least one episode of CIN, the first CIN event occurred during the first 3 months of treatment in 110 (63%). Among patients with at least one episode of CIN, 79 (45%) received subsequent granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). The median OS in the overall cohort was 171 months. For patients with and without CIN the median OS had not been reached, HR 0.84 (95% CI 0.55-1.29, p=0.43). The median OS for patients with CIN treated with and without GCSF had not been reached, HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.57-1.82, p=0.94). The 5-year survival rate for patients with and without CIN was 87% vs 77%. The 10-year survival rate for patients with and without CIN was 70% vs 64%. A trend toward improved survival in those with CIN remained when results were analyzed by cancer stage. Conclusions: Patients with CIN had a trend toward improved survival compared to those who did not have CIN. There was no indication that GCSF in the setting of CIN impacted survival. The causes for the potentially protective effect of CIN in the setting of adjuvant CRC treatment require further elucidation.CharacteristicResult, n (%)Age ≥6599 (33%)Male178 (59%)ECOG PS0283 (94%)119 (6%)Clinical StageII36 (12%)III (Low risk, T1-3, N1)118 (39%)III (High risk, T4 and/or N2)148 (49%)',\n",

       "  '82Background: The impact of pain on functional status and neuropsychological disorders among older adults with cancer is relevant, yet poorly understood. We sought to identify the prevalence of pain at diagnosis in older adults with GI malignancies and evaluate the association between pain and functional status limitations, cognition, and mental health issues. Methods: This study included patients diagnosed with cancer at age ≥60 years and enrolled in the CARE Registry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Patients completed a patient-reported geriatric assessment at their initial visit with a medical oncologist. Patients rated pain on a numeric scale from 0-10. We employed the literature-based cut off for moderate-severe pain of ≥4. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the association between moderate/severe pain and functional status, falls, cognition, and depression/anxiety. We adjusted the models for sex, race, education, race/ethnicity, marital status, cancer type, and cancer stage. Results: Our cohort included 714 older adults. Median age at diagnosis was 70y (range 60-96) and 59% were male. Median time between diagnosis and study participation was 37 days. Most prevalent diagnoses included colorectal (27.9%), pancreatic (18%), hepatobiliary (11.5%) and gastroesophageal (6.4%) cancers. Overall, 53.1% of the participants reported none/mild (0-3) pain, 25.6% reported moderate (4-7) pain, and 21.4% reported severe (8-10) pain. In univariate analyses, Black patients, lower education, disabled employment, and pancreatic cancer was associated with moderate/severe pain. After multivariate adjusting for covariates, participants with moderate/severe pain were more likely to report limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1-6.1, p <.001), limitations in activities of daily living (aOR 3.2, 95% CI 2.0-5.1, p <.001), falls (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6, p <.001), cognitive complaints (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0, p <.004), anxiety (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.4, p < 0.01), and depression (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.2-6.5, p <.001). Conclusions: Pain is common amongst older adults with GI cancers and is associated with functional status limitations, falls, cognitive complaints, and depression/anxiety. Strategies to reduce pain and/or minimize its potential impact on function and mental health warrant future research.',\n",

       "  '83Background: For colorectal cancer patients treated with the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin, oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) is a serious side effect. We conducted an observational comparative effectiveness study to evaluate whether several potential preventives reduced the rate of OIPN diagnosis in the two years following chemotherapy initiation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database combined with Medicare claims (SEER-Medicare). Eligible patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2007-2015, 66 years of age or older, and received at least two cycles of oxaliplatin. We used two definitions to denote diagnosis of OIPN: OIPN 1 (diagnosis codes specific to CIPN) and OIPN 2 (additional codes for peripheral neuropathy). Multinomial propensity score weighting was used to balance potential confounders. The Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model was used to perform a competing risk, time to event analysis for diagnosis of OIPN. Results: There were 4,482 subjects analyzed for the outcome of OIPN 1 (n = 477, 10.1%), and 4,561 for OIPN 2 (n = 1,191, 26.1%). Duloxetine, venlafaxine (marginally significant for OIPN 1), opioids, and minocycline were associated with a decreased rate of OIPN according to both definitions. In addition, memantine and neuromuscular therapy were associated with a decreased rate of OIPN 1 but not OIPN 2. Gabapentin and pregabalin exposure was associated with an increased rate of OIPN diagnosis according to both definitions. Mixed results were obtained for nortriptyline and cannabinoids. Conclusions: This study revealed several potentially effective preventive options for OIPN in colorectal cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin. A limitation of this study is the observational design which cannot directly inform treatment guidelines. However, evidence from this study may serve as preliminary data to support a future randomized clinical trial.Relative hazard rate for potential preventives of OIPN.OIPN 1OIPN 2sHR95% CIpsHR95% CIpDuloxetine HCLNoRefRefYes0.360.29-0.45<0.0010.760.69-0.83<0.001MemantineNoRefRefYes0.600.47-0.78<0.0011.020.91-1.140.774NortriptylineNoRefRefYes0.960.69-1.330.7880.650.52-0.82<0.001VenlafaxineNoRefRefYes0.850.42-0.560.0770.490.42-0.56<0.001GabapentinNoRefRefYes1.811.65-1.98<0.0011.931.83-2.04<0.001PregabalinNoRefRefYes1.211.04-1.420.0151.391.28-1.51<0.001CannabinoidsNoRefRefYes0.780.58-1.060.1171.241.06-1.450.009OpioidsNoRefRefYes0.610.56-0.67<0.0010.890.84-0.94<0.001MinocyclineNoRefRefYes0.720.61-0.86<0.0010.880.77-0.990.034Neuromuscular therapyNoRefRefYes0.580.52-0.64<0.0011.271.21-1.35<0.001Abbreviations: sHR, subdistribution hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; ref, reference group.',\n",

       "  '84Background: We evaluated the impact of baseline sarcopenia on hematologic toxicity, treatment intensity, and healthcare utilization in patients with mCRC receiving FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with mCRC who received care at our institution from 1/2011-11/2018 and were part of a biobanking protocol. Included adults received either first-line palliative FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI-based regimens and were followed for 6 months. We categorized sarcopenia based on skeletal muscle index measured at diagnosis of metastatic disease and pre-defined sex-specific cutoff values (F < 39 cm2/m2, M < 55cm2/m2). Our primary aim was to evaluate the association of sarcopenia and hematologic toxicity, defined as the incidence of grade ≥3 (G≥3) neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia (NCI CTCAE v5.0). Secondary endpoints included treatment intensity (dose reductions, treatment delays, relative-dose intensity [RDI]), and healthcare utilization (ED visits and/or hospitalizations). Bivariate analyses were used to evaluate associations between baseline sarcopenia and outcomes. Results: 126 of 177 screened patients met inclusion criteria (70 (56%) males, median age 61 yrs (range, 29-85)). 59 (46.8%) patients were sarcopenic. More patients received FOLFOX than FOLFIRI (92 [73.0%] vs. 34 [27.0%]). At baseline, patients had a median weight 76.9kg (IQR, 70.0-90.4 kg), BMI 26.6 kg/m2 (IQR, 24.1-30.5 kg/m2), and BSA 1.90 m2 (IQR, 1.72-2.01 m2). The incidence of G≥3 hematologic toxicity was 39.0% vs. 23.9% in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, respectively (p = 0.06). Patients with sarcopenia experienced higher incidence of G≥3 neutropenia (30.5% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.03), while G≥3 thrombocytopenia was similar (3.4% vs. 1.5%). The incidence of dose reductions and treatment delays did not differ significantly (86.4% vs. 89.5%, 72.9% vs. 71.6%, respectively). RDI was decreased for the 5FU bolus (52.5% vs. 65.0%, p = 0.02). Rates of ED visits (32.2% vs. 19.4%, p = 0.10) and hospitalizations (32.2% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.51) did not differ compared between patients with and without sarcopenia. Conclusions: Patients with mCRC and baseline sarcopenia receiving FOLFOX- or FOLFIRI experienced a higher incidence of G≥3 neutropenia and lower 5FU bolus treatment intensity. Studies are needed to understand how best to adjust treatment according to patients’ muscle mass.',\n",

       "  '85Background: Effective first-line therapy is a key determinant of treatment outcomes and should be selected after considering both clinical factors and biological markers in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Considering the increased number of cancer patients with old age and their chronic diseases, it is essential to select a therapeutic agent by evaluating the toxicity that may occur due to long-term chemotherapy. This study assessed changes in renal function for 1 year in patients diagnosed with mCRC during chemotherapy and analyzed the factors and effect of each chemotherapy regimen on renal function. Methods: We retrospectively investigated patients with mCRC treated with palliative 1st line chemotherapy at our institution from 2015 to 2020. According to the common 1st line treatment regimen, we divided into 4 groups; FOLFOX/FOLFIRI with bevacizumab/cetuximab. We checked the baseline renal function and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the start of chemotherapy. The change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (△eGFR) was calculated as [(eGFR at each time point) - (eGFR at baseline)/(eGFR at baseline) X 100]. The clinical factors such as age, gender, chronic disease, BMI (body mass index), disease status, baseline proteinuria, and 1st line chemotherapy regimen were evaluated. Proteinuria was detected on urine dipstick protein ≥ 1+. Additionally, predictors for ΔeGFR ≤ −30% at each time points after therapy initiation were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 466 mCRC patients, the median eGFR values at baseline was 95.4 ml/min/1.73m2. The median eGFR at 6 months after chemotherapy initiation were significantly lower than baseline (88.3 ml/min/1.73m2, p < 0.001). As 1 year, patients with more than 30% worsening of renal function was observed in 27.6 % in FOLFIRI + bevacizumab, 26.3 % in FOLFOX + bevacizumab, 6.6 % in FOLFIRI + cetuximab, and 4.7 % in FOLFOX + cetuximab group. The FOLFIRI + bevacizumab was an independent predictor for ΔeGFR ≤ −30% at 6 months (odds ratio (OR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-3.47, p = 0.034) along with old age (≥ 65 years, OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.29-3.68, p = 0.004) and BMI (p = 0.012). Additionally, FOLFIRI + bevacizumab regimen causes more proteinuria (46.4%) than other chemotherapy regimens. Conclusions: Deterioration of renal function was more common with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab than other combination regimen. Old age, BMI were also associated decreasing eGFR. These results will be helpful to be suggested as important consideration when selecting the 1st line chemotherapy regimen for mCRC.',\n",

       "  '86Background: Adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment of UICC-stage III/IV colon cancer with fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is widely accepted as the current standard after R0-resection. However, with continuous improvement of patients´ survival and life expectancy, long-term side effects of chemotherapy such as second cancer development are becoming increasingly important. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data derived from the population-based cancer registry at the Regensburg Tumor Center, Germany. Patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer UICC stage III and IV between 2002 and 2018 and underwent R0 surgical resection of primary tumor were included for the study. Second cancer was as defined new tumor occurrence at least 6 months after beginning of chemotherapy and in another localization compared to primary tumor. Second cancer rate was compared between patients with and patients without adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Data of totally 2,856 Patients with UICC-stage III/IV colon cancer were analyzed, 1,520 (53.2%) of whom received adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 223 (7.8%) patients developed a subsequent second cancer. Most frequent second cancers were prostate cancer (18.4%), colon cancer (16.1%), breast cancers (8.1%), lung cancer (8.1%), rectal cancer (4.9%) and uterine cancer (4.9%). However, patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy did not have a significantly increased risk for second cancer development compared to patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (Table). Interestingly, our data suggest a significantly decreased second cancer rate in patients treated with FOLFOX compared to FUFOL for adjuvant treatment. Conclusions: Second cancer development was not increased after adjuvant chemotherapy for UICC-stage III/IV colon cancer, which is a novel aspect in the ongoing discussions on reduction of adjuvant treatment to 3 months or treatment of lymph node negative patients.

       "  '87Background: In primary analysis from the TRUSTY study, trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) plus bevacizumab (BEV) failed to show non-inferiority to irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine plus BEV in overall survival (OS) as second-line treatment in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) (median OS, 14.8 vs. 18.1 months: HR, 1.38: 95% CI; 0.99-1.93: p = 0.59 for non-inferiority; Kuboki Y, et\\xa0al. ASCO 2021). Here we report a post hoc efficacy analysis by baseline tumor burden. Methods: Pts with histologically confirmed mCRC who failed first-line chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin plus either BEV or an anti-EGFR antibody were eligible. Pts were randomized to receive either FTD/TPI plus BEV (FTD/TPI plus BEV group, FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1–5 and 8–12 every 28-day cycle, and BEV 5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15) or either FOLFIRI or S-1 and irinotecan combined with BEV (control group). Efficacy measured by OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR) were compared between pts grouped by baseline sum of diameter of target lesions (STL). Survival curves were drawn by direct survival estimation adjusted for stratification factors. Results: In the ITT population (N = 396), 60 mm was selected as the optimal cutoff for STL because it produced the most significant difference in OS; 151 pts had high tumor burden with STL ≥ 60 mm (FTD/TPI plus BEV, n = 76: control, n = 75), 216 had low tumor burden with STL < 60 mm (n = 107, n = 109), and 29 were excluded due to no measurable lesions. Baseline characteristics in pts with both high and low tumor burden were balanced between treatment groups. In pts with STL ≥ 60 mm, FTD/TPI plus BEV was less effective than the control: adjusted median OS was 10.9 versus 16.2 months (HR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.42-3.79), median PFS was 3.5 versus 6.1 months (HR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.52-3.53): and DCR was 53.9% versus 72.0% (p = 0.03). In pts with STL < 60 mm, FTD/TPI plus BEV was comparably effective to the control: median OS was 21.4 versus 20.7 months (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.55-1.55), median PFS was 5.6 versus 6.0 months (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 0.87-1.72), and DCR was 66.4% versus 71.6% (p = 0.46). Conclusions: FTD/TPI + BEV might be a second-line treatment option for mCRC pts with low tumor burden (STL < 60 mm). Clinical trial information: jRCTs031180122.',\n",

       "  '88Background: Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is given alone or in combination with chemotherapy in the 60% of mCRC that are KRAS WT. Unfortunately, resistance inevitably develops, which may be related to downstream upregulation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Rechallenge with anti-EGFR mAb may be effective in patients previously benefiting from anti-EGFR therapy, but median progression-free survival is < 4 months, indicating need for novel more effective combinations for rechallenge. Co-inhibition of EGFR and downstream cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) may overcome ERK pathway reactivation. We hypothesized that the addition of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib to cetuximab would be effective for anti-EGFR rechallenge in KRAS-WT mCRC. Methods: LCCC1717 was a multicenter, single-arm, Simon’s two stage phase II study of cetuximab and palbociclib in KRAS WT mCRC treated with ≥2 prior regimens (NCT03446157). Eligible pts were enrolled to one of two cohorts depending on previous anti-EGFR mAb therapy; we report here on cohort B, which enrolled pts who had disease control for at least 4 months with anti-EGFR therapy. Cohort B was designed to initially enroll 10 evaluable pts; if ≥ 4 pts had disease control at least 4 months, then 11 more pts would be enrolled. Treatment included cetuximab 400 mg/m2 followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly, plus palbociclib 125 mg daily on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle until progression, toxicity, or withdrawal. Primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) at 4 months by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: In cohort B, 10 evaluable pts were enrolled from 2/2018-8/2020 (1 additional pt withdrew after an infusion reaction with first dose of cetuximab). Median age 59, 70% male, 90% left-sided primary. The 4-mo DCR was 2/10 (20%; 95% CI 5-52%). Given this, enrollment in this cohort was halted after first stage. Median PFS was 1.8 mo (95% CI: 1.7, NE) and median OS was 6.6 mo (95% CI: 3.6, NE). No pts had a complete or partial response; 3 pts (30%) had stable disease (SD), including 1 patient with SD for 24.7 months. The regimen was well tolerated; most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (27%) and leukopenia (18%). While 55% of pts had acneiform rash, none were grade 3-4. Conclusions: Selection of patients for anti-EGFR rechallenge using clinical criteria alone was insufficient to identify pts likely to respond to palbociclib + cetuximab rechallenge. This emphasizes the need for screening using circulating tumor (ct) DNA of known resistance mutations to select pts for anti-EGFR rechallenge approaches. Translational work assessing ctDNA in this study is planned. Cohort A with anti-EGFR naïve patients continues enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT03446157.',\n",

       "  '89Background: Combination treatment with regorafenib (80–120 mg/day, PO, 3 wks on/1 wk off) plus nivolumab (480 mg IV Q4W) showed manageable safety but modest efficacy in a phase 2 study of 70 pts from North America with pMMR/MSS chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRC (mCRC). Five pts had a partial response (PR; objective response rate [ORR]: 7%); all did not have liver metastases at baseline (n = 5/23; ORR: 22%). One pt had a confirmed complete response (CR) after the primary completion analysis of the study (ASCO 2021). This retrospective exploratory analysis investigated the potential association between specific biomarkers and anti-tumor activity, and how those biomarkers are modulated by treatment with regorafenib plus nivolumab. Methods: In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples obtained at baseline and Cycle (C) 2 Day (D) 8, immune-related biomarkers were assessed via immunohistochemistry (IHC), and RNA sequencing was used for gene expression profiling/gene signatures. Pre-/on-treatment blood samples were collected to measure circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and soluble biomarkers. Results: A total of 40 and 27 baseline tumor samples and 14 and 5 paired tumor samples at baseline/C2D8 were available for IHC and RNA sequencing, respectively. Higher baseline protein and mRNA expression of biomarkers for pre-existing immune sensitivity (eg, effector T cells) trended with anti-tumor activity. These biomarkers were expressed at lower levels in pts with liver metastases vs those without liver metastases at baseline. Cytotoxic T cell density was elevated on C2D8 but did not correlate with anti-tumor activity. Increased mean variant allelic frequency in ctDNA at C2D1 predominated in pts with progressive disease (PD), while clearance of ctDNA at C2D1 was only noted for the one pt with a CR. High clonal tumor mutational burden in ctDNA showed a numerical trend with anti-tumor activity (PD vs. SD/PR; P=0.058) and PFS (P = 0.072). Baseline serum levels of select markers related to angiogenesis (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] D) were associated with inferior anti-tumor activity (P = 0.002). Serum levels of immune-related soluble biomarkers (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha) increased on treatment (P < 0.005), while levels of soluble VEGF receptor 2 decreased (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study of pts with MSS mCRC treated with regorafenib plus nivolumab suggests that baseline tumor biomarkers for pre-existing immune sensitivity trended with anti-tumor activity, whereas select baseline peripheral biomarkers related to angiogenesis trended with inferior anti-tumor activity. Pharmacodynamics effects were observed, yet no significant correlation with anti-tumor activity was found. Due to the small sample size and retrospective nature, these analyses are hypothesis-generating. Clinical trial information: NCT04126733.',\n",

       "  '90Background: Due to the relative infrequency of high grade appendiceal adenocarcinoma with peritoneal metastases, there is limited data to guide treatment strategies. Current practices for this disease are largely extrapolated from colon cancer patients with peritoneal metastases, who typically undergo six months of systemic chemotherapy in conjunction with cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS/HIPEC). The optimal timing of chemotherapy in relation to CRS/HIPEC remains unknown. In this study, we compare the efficacy of peri-operative chemotherapy to pre-operative chemotherapy alone. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC for high grade appendiceal cancers from a tertiary referral center from 2014-2020. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent planned 6 months of chemotherapy followed by CRS/HIPEC (pre-operative group) versus planned 3 months of chemotherapy both pre- and post-operatively (peri-operative group). Results: 85 patients were treated for metastatic high-grade appendiceal cancers during the study period, of whom24 were eligible for inclusion. Of those included, 16 were in the peri-operative group and 8 in the pre-operative group. Most patients were white (75%), non-Hispanic (96%) and female (54%). Patients in the pre-operative group tended to be older (65 vs. 56 years, p = 0.02). For patients with specified histologic grading, poorly differentiated tumors were common (50%). Signet ring cell histology (42%) and mucinous features (67%) were frequent as well. Median overall survival was similar between the pre-operative and peri-operative groups (32.3 vs. 31.6 months, p = 0.97), although patients undergoing peri-operative treatment received fewer total cycles of chemotherapy on average (14.1 vs. 9.5 cycles, p < 0.01). Half of the patients in the peri-operative group (8/16) did not complete their chemotherapy regimen, with 75% discontinuing therapy due to chemotherapy-related toxicities. Within the peri-operative group, a non-significant decrease in median survival was observed for those who did not complete chemotherapy (27.8 vs > 53.6 months, p = 0.22). Conclusions: Peri-operative and total pre-operative chemotherapy strategies are associated with similar survival in patients with high grade appendiceal cancers undergoing CRS/HIPEC. Peri-operative administration may be limited by chemotherapy-related toxicities.',\n",

       "  '92Background: Since the publication of the MOSAIC trial, stage III CC has been treated with a six-month (mo) regimen of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin). Recently, the IDEA collaboration challenged this practice by demonstrating that the 3-year rate of disease-free survival (DFS) was non-inferior to 6mo of treatment (Rx) when given for low risk CC (83.1 vs. 83.3%) and resulted in significantly lower rates of grade 2 and higher neuropathy. In high risk (T4, N2) patients (pts) the DFS of 3mo of CAPOX was equivocal to 6mo (64.1 vs. 64.0%), while 3mo of FOLFOX was inferior to 6mo (61.5 vs. 64.7%). We hypothesized that trends in prescribing would favor shorter courses of Rx with a preference towards CAPOX given its efficacy across both high and low risk CC. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of stage III CC pts from 4 institutions. We evaluated prescribing patterns of 3mo or 6mo of Rx and CAPOX vs. FOLFOX over a period of 5 years from Jan 2016 to Jan 2021, a time period that traverses before and after the release of IDEA. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression models, with a linear time trend, were used to estimate the percentage of pts receiving CAPOX vs. FOLFOX and the combination of Rx and duration, respectively, while adjusting for baseline characteristics. The prescribing patterns in important subgroups were examined by incorporating the interaction term in the models. Results: A total of 366 pts met inclusion criteria. From 2016-2021, there was a significant increase per quarter in patients treated with CAPOX when compared to FOLFOX (OR 1.16 95% CI 1.11 – 1.21, p <.001). Prior to IDEA, 78.3% of pts received 6mo FOLFOX and 7.4% received 3mo CAPOX. Two years after IDEA, only 17.3% of pts were on 6mo FOLFOX compared to 67.5% of pts on 3mo CAPOX (Table). At present, high risk pts are more likely to receive 6mo FOLFOX (47.8%) than 3mo of FOLFOX (3.9%), 3mo CAPOX (25.8%), or 6mo CAPOX (22.4%). Low risk pts are more likely to receive 3mo of CAPOX (67.9%) than other Rx. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that since IDEA, physician practice has significantly changed in favor of CAPOX and shorter courses of Rx. The use of CAPOX has significantly increased overall, presumably due to its efficacy across all risk groups and relatively reduced toxicity.Percentage of pts receiving 3mo vs. 6mo of CAPOX vs. FOLFOX before and after the IDEA collaboration.%----------CAPOX--------------------FOLFOX----------Any duration3mo6moAny duration3mo6moJune 201616.37.46.583.77.978.3June 202066.867.55.933.29.317.3------------------------------Low Risk------------------------------June 2016---7.25.6---8.379.0June 2020---67.96.6---8.716.8------------------------------High Risk------------------------------June 2016---1.311.2---0.986.6June 2020---25.922.4---3.947.8',\n",

       "  '93Background: Fruquintinib (F) is a highly selective, novel, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3. The phase (Ph) 3 FRESCO study (NCT02314819) that investigated F (5mg daily, 3 weeks (wks) on 1 wk off) showed improved median overall survival in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in third line and beyond when compared to placebo (9.3 vs. 6.6 months); hazard ratio 0.65 (P < 0.001) and led to its approval in China. Methods: This is an ongoing Ph 1/1b open-label, dose escalation/expansion study conducted in the US. Here we present the preliminary safety and antitumor efficacy data from pts with refractory mCRC in Cohort (Coh) B (progressed on all standard therapies including TAS-102 [TAS] and/or regorafenib [R]) and in Coh C (did not receive TAS or R). Results: As of data cutoff on 27 July 2021, 81 mCRC pts had been treated (41 in Coh B and 40 in Coh C); median age of 57 years (range: 34─77), Caucasian (81.5%), female (44.4%), and ECOG PS 1 (59.3%). In Coh B, the median number of prior therapies was 5 (range: 3-9), 8 pts (19.5%) received R, 19 (46.3%) received TAS and 14 (34.1%) received both R and TAS. In Coh C, the median number of prior therapies was 4 (range: 1-10). Five pts remain on treatment; reasons for treatment discontinuation included: 56 pts (69.1%) due to progressive disease or death, 8 pts (9.9%) due to adverse events (AE), and 12 pts (14.8%) due to withdrawal of consent or physician decision. The median duration of F treatment was 4.4 months (range: 0.7– 20.0) in Coh B and 3.7 months (range: 0.02-14.3) in Coh C. The most frequently reported AEs of any grade in Coh B were fatigue (53.7%), proteinuria (51.2%), and hypertension (HTN; 48.8%). In Coh C the most frequently reported AEs of any grade were HTN (75.0%), proteinuria (40.0%), and myalgia (32.5%). Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) was reported in 29.3% of Coh B pts and 22.5% of Coh C pts. The disease control rate [DCR] was 68.3% in Coh B (1 partial response [PR] and 27 stable disease [SD]) and 59.5% for the 37 patients with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment in Coh C (2 PRs and 20 SDs). Conclusions: F is generally well-tolerated in heavily-pretreated pts with refractory mCRC. Evidence of antitumor activity was observed in cohorts B and C. The multi-cohort dose expansion is ongoing. F is being further investigated in refractory mCRC in a global Ph 3 study (NCT04322539). Clinical trial information: NCT03251378.',\n",

       "  '94Background: The achievement of a pathological complete response with preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer has been found to correlate with a reduced incidence of local and distant recurrences. With the radiosensetizing properties of gemcitabine, we tested the efficacy and toxicity of preoperative concurrent infusional gemcitabine and radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Methods: This was a phase II, single-arm, single-institution trial. Eligibility included a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma with stage T2–4 and/or nodal involvement by MRI and endoscopic rectal ultrasound, age ≥ 18 years and no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients received preoperative radiation at a dose of 50.4–54 Gy over 28 days with concurrent infusional gemcitabine administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 over the course of 24 hours weekly for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was a pathological complete response (pCR). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02919878). Results: Forty patients were enrolled in the study. All of the patients completed the planned therapy, except for one patient who died at the end of his concurrent chemoradiation. Eight patients did not undergo surgery, with 1 patient dying (mentioned above), 2 patients progressing to nonresectable disease and 5 patients withdrawing consent. Six patients progressed prior to or had metastases identified at surgery, with 2 patients having unresectable metastases, 3 patients having resectable liver metastases and 1 patient having a peritoneal metastasis (not resected). Serious adverse events were reported in 8 patients (20%). The most common grade 3–4 toxicities in the preoperative period included lymphopenia (50%), neutropenia (41%), anemia (15%), diarrhea (12%), abdominal pain (12%) and proctitis (8%). Out of the 32 patients who underwent surgery, 7 patients achieved pCR at a rate of 20%. With a median follow-up of 30 months, 4 additional patients relapsed (all of these patients had distant metastases, with one subsequently having a local recurrence). The 3-year event-free and overall survival rates were 70% and 85%, respectively. Conclusions: Concurrent preoperative chemoradiotherapy using infusional gemcitabine for locally advanced rectal cancer achieved an encouraging local control. Distant metastasis remains not decreased. Further investigations of a preoperative regimen containing gemcitabine is warranted. Clinical trial information: NCT02919878.',\n",

       "  '95Background: Oxaliplatin, a major drug in metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC), is responsible for a cumulative and limiting peripheral neuropathy (PN). Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy, which makes sense in cases of exclusive or predominant liver metastases, increases the intratumor concentration of the administered drug(s) to improve efficacy and limit systemic toxicity. Methods: We compared the frequency and severity of NP in oxaliplatin-naive patients with MCRC included in trials that evaluated treatment with oxaliplatin administered either by HAI (CHOICE, OSCAR, and PACHA-01 trials) or by intravenous (IV) route (FFCD 2000-05 trial). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of clinically significant NP (grade 2-4) according to the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin received. The secondary endpoints were the occurence of severe NP (grade 3-4) and time to onset of NP. Results: 342 patients were included (IV oxaliplatin: 300; HAI: 42). 180 patients in the IV group (60%) and 24 patients in the HAI group (57%) developed clinically significant NP, with no significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.85). 95 patients in the IV group (32%) and 8 patients in the HAI group (19%) developed severe NP, with no significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.082). NP appeared earlier in the HAI group, with more treatment discontinuations for neurotoxicity. Conclusions: The administration of oxaliplatin HAI rather than IV in the treatment of MCRC does not seem to reduce the incidence, precocity and severity of NP.',\n",

       "  '96Background: The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is one of the most frequently deleted or mutated genes in gastrointestinal cancers. Normal p53 regulates several important proteins that control cell cycle, cell death, DNA damage/repair, stemness, differentiation and other key cellular functions. If the TP53 gene is damaged, tumor suppression is severely compromised. On the other hand, and downstream of p53, p21 a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) protein binds and inhibitsthe activity of cyclin - CDK2, - CDK1, and - CDK4/6, thus functioning as a regulator ofcell cycle progression at G 1 and S phase. It can act as de facto p53 repair/ replacement mechanism. We have thus hypothesised that, if we were able to deliver wild type p21 into all p53 mutated cancer cells, it would have a possible therapeutic effect. Methods: We have constructed recombinantly a new fusion protein, named AB1, composed of a cell penetrating protein (antennapedia) ANTP and wild type p21 and tested it in in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo preclinical models prior to clinical studies. AB1 could also be constructed semi-synthetically by conjugating recombinant ANTP chemically to p21 protein. Results: AB1 penetrated and killed p53 mutated cancer cells but did not kill cells that did not have p53 mutations AB1 penetrated but did not kill p53- or p21- wild-type cells. AB1 was not immunogenic in normal New Zealand White rabbits. AB1 was more cytotoxic when administered with conventionally-used chemotherapeutic agents. Conclusions: We have generated a selectively cytotoxic fusion protein against p53 mutated GI cancers which is effective when used as a single agent but more so when used in combination with chemotherapy. The phaseI/II clinical trial will include eligible patients who have p53 mutated GI cancers',\n",

The current study was aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pyrotinib and trastuzumab in patients with HER2 positive colorectal cancer. Methods: HER2-FUSCC-G is an ongoing, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2a study. Patients in this subset were diagnosed as HER2 positive metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies. All the enrolled patients were treated with a loading dose of trastuzumab at 8 mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg once every three weeks, and oral pyrotinib at 400 mg per day until progression. ORR was set as the primary endpoint. Estimates of PFS (progression free survival) and OS (overall survival) were obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with log-rank test. Results: Between January 2020 to June 2021, 11 patients were enrolled in this study. The ORR was 45.5% in whole population, and 55.6% in RAS wild-type patients. At a median follow-up of 17.73 months, median PFS and OS were 7.80 and 14.97 months, respectively.

Module C of the platform is assessing ezabenlimab plus BI 836880, a humanized bispecific nanobody targeting VEGF/Ang2. Pts are being enrolled into 5 advanced solid tumor cohorts: gastric/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma; solid tumors (except non-squamous NSCLC or melanoma) with secondary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 treatment (progression after at least SD for ≥4 months); solid tumors with primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 treatment; microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC; mismatch repair-proficient/MSS endometrial carcinoma. Here, we report data from the CRC cohort which has completed recruitment. Methods: Pts with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic, MSS CRC were enrolled. Patients had received ≥1 line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease but were anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy-naïve. Prior anti-angiogenic therapy was permitted.

At data cut-off (Sep 2021), median duration (range) of treatment was 115.5 (28–295) days; 6 pts remain on treatment. 1 (3%) pt (who had not received prior bevacizumab) achieved a confirmed PR; 16 (53%) pts had SD. Median duration (range) of SD was 128.5 (42–242) days. 29/17/2 (97/57/7%) pts had an AE (any/G3/G4). The most frequent AEs (any/G3) were nausea (40/10%), fatigue (30/3%), peripheral edema (30/0%), vomiting (27/7%), and hypertension (27/17%). There were two G4 AEs (hypertension; platelet count decreased) and no G5 AEs. 24/10/2 (80/33/7%) pts had a drug-related AE (any/G3/G4); most commonly (any/G3) nausea (33/7%), fatigue (27/3%) and hypertension (27/17%). 3 (10%) pts had an infusion-related reaction (G1, n = 1; G2, n = 2). 2 (7%) pts had an AE leading to discontinuation (G3 bile duct stone and G2 peripheral edema). Immune-related AEs were reported in 6 (20%) pts and serious AEs occurred in 13 (43%) pts. Conclusions: BI 836880 plus ezabenlimab had a manageable safety profile in pts with advanced MSS CRC; however, anti-tumor activity was limited in these pts, the majority of whom had received prior bevacizumab.

       "  '99Background: Although immunotherapy shows no benefit in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, preclinical models suggest that radiotherapy (RT) can enhance neoantigen presentation, modulate the microenvironment, and improve the likelihood of anti-tumor activity with checkpoint inhibitor use. Using a “window-of-opportunity” study design, this prospective phase II trial will determine the safety and activity of this approach with the anti-PD-L1 agent durvalumab (MEDI4736). Methods: Stage II/III patients (pts) with MSS rectal cancer undergoing standard NCCN guideline-compliant neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by definitive surgery were eligible. Treatment included durvalumab (750mg IV infusion once every 2 wks) for 4 total doses beginning within 3-7 days after CRT completion followed by surgery within 8-12 wks of the final CRT dose. Primary end point (EP): Improvement in modified neoadjuvant rectal cancer (mNAR) score (goal 10.6) compared to historical controls (15.6) targeting a 20% DFS RR reduction and 3-4% absolute OS improvement. Secondary EPs: toxicity, pCR, cCR, therapy completion, negative surgical margins, sphincter preservation, and exploratory assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor Immunoscore, circulating immunologic profiles, and molecular predictors of response. We test H0: mNAR ≥15.6 vs HA: mNAR <15.6 at alpha 0.10 one-sided with statistical significance defined as p<0.1. Results: From May 2018 to October 2020, 45 pts were enrolled with 40 pts evaluable for mNAR. Mean mNAR was 12.03 (80% CI: 9.29-14.97) (p=0.06 one-sided). pCR=22.2%; cCR=31.1%; R0 resection=81.0%, and sphincter preservation=71.4%. Side effects were consistent with both CRT and durvalumab safety profile. Most common grade 3 AEs included diarrhea, lymphopenia, and back pain. There was one grade 4 AE (elevated amylase/lipase) and no grade 5 AEs. Remaining secondary and correlative immunologic end points are still being assessed. Conclusions: Durvalumab immediately following CRT prior to surgery for definitive management of rectal cancer was safe and without unexpected short-term toxicities. The primary end point of mean mNAR score was significantly less than our historical control, warranting further investigation. Correlative analyses for immunologic markers of response including PD-(L)1 expression and Immunoscore are ongoing. NCT 03102047. Support: AstraZeneca-Medimmune, NSABP Foundation.

       "  '100Background: CRC is a common cancer world-wide, accounting for ̃10% of cancer cases and mortality. Treatment options are limited, and survival is poor for pts with advanced disease, particularly those with mKRAS. After failure of 1L treatment for mCRC, regardless of KRAS mutation status, the ORR for FOLFIRI-bev is 5-13%, with PFS 4-6 mos, and OS 10-12 mos. Onvansertib is a highly selective, ATP-competitive, orally bioavailable PLK1 inhibitor that is synergistic with irinotecan and with 5FU in xenograft models of mKRAS CRC. We present preliminary safety, efficacy, and biomarker data from an ongoing Ph1b/2 trial of onvansertib + FOLFIRI-bev in pts with mKRAS mCRC progressing after 1L treatment with fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin, +/- bev. Methods: Pts with mCRC with a KRAS mutation detected by a CLIA-certified lab were eligible. In the Ph1b portion of the study, onvansertib was given on a 3+3 dose escalation at 12, 15 or 18 mg/m2 on days 1-5 and 15-19 of each 28-day cycle in combination with FOLFIRI-bev. The MTD was 15 mg/m2 and was chosen as the RP2D. The primary endpoint for the Ph2 was ORR, and radiographic response was assessed every 8 wks per RECIST v1.1. Safety was evaluated continuously, and AEs were recorded using CTCAE v5.0. Baseline and post-treatment blood samples were collected for biomarker analyses, including mutant allele frequency (MAF) of the pt’s known KRAS mutation. Results: As of 16Sep2021, a total of 50 pts had been treated: 18 on the Ph1b and 32 on the Ph2, including 35 pts at the RP2D, and median follow up was 4.7 mos (range 0.4-18). Of the 50 pts, 26 remain on treatment, as do 24 of 35 RP2D pts. The combination was well-tolerated: fatigue, neutropenia, and nausea were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and were generally low-grade. Neutropenia was managed by removing the 5FU bolus from subsequent cycles of FOLFIRI and adding growth factor. Of the 50 pts, 44 were evaluable for efficacy, including 31 of 35 RP2D pts. ORR was 36% for the total group (1CR and 15 PR in 44 pts) and 35% for the RP2D group (1 CR and 10 PR in 31 pts). First responses were seen between 2 and 6 months after the start of therapy. Responses were observed across different KRAS variants. Pts achieving a CR or PR showed the greatest decreases in plasma MAF after the first cycle of therapy. Of the 50 pts, 24 pts have discontinued for the following reasons: progressive disease (13), toxicity (4), patient decision (4), proceeding to potentially curative surgery or other localized therapy (3). Conclusions: The combination of onvansertib with FOLFIRI-bev was well tolerated: observed TEAEs have been generally low-grade and manageable. The combination has demonstrated a promising ORR in 2L treatment of mCRC pts harboring various KRAS mutations, and efficacy was correlated with early changes in plasma mKRAS. Updated safety, efficacy, and biomarker analyses will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT03829410.',\n",

       "  '101Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality have decreased since the 1970s, but the incidence in young adults (20-49 years, named early-onset CRC, eoCRC) has been increasing. eoCRC patients with metastatic disease are treated with the same standard regimens as late-onset CRC (loCRC, age ≥ 50 years) although detailed response data for eoCRC are largely missing. Methods: Individual patient data on 7,604 subjects with metastatic eoCRC from 11 first line randomized bevacizumab studies between 2000 and 2012 in the ARCAD advanced colorectal cancer database were pooled. The distributions of demographics, clinicopathological features, biomarkers, and outcome data were summarized by age groups. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models stratified by treatment arms within studies, adjusting for potential confounders. Predictive value of age group was evaluated by testing interaction effect between treatment and age variables. Results: Female eoCRC are more commonly seen compared to loCRC (46.8% vs. 38.7%, p<0.0001). Patients with eoCRC (n=1,289) were significantly more likely to have had prior metastasectomy (17.5% vs. 13.5%, p=0.043) and lung metastatic disease (67% vs. 59.8%, p<0.001), but less likely to have distant lymph node metastatic disease (58.8 vs. 62.9%, p=0.036) or KRAS mutation (29.2% vs. 34.4%, p=0.042) compared to those with loCRC (n=6,315). eoCRC and loCRC patients had similar distributions according to PS, primary tumor sidedness, prior primary tumor resection, liver involvement, peritoneal involvement, number of metastatic sites, NRAS and BRAF. Age of disease onset was not a statistically significant prognostic factor for PFS in univariate and multivariate analysis (seen in table). Bevacizumab in addition to chemo improved PFS in eoCRC population (9.9 vs. 6.8 months, HR = 0.66, p<0.001), which was similar to the findings in loCRC population (9.4 vs. 7.3 months, HR= 0.73, p<0.001, interaction p=0.54). By multivariate analysis, a greater improvement in PFS was noted for the addition of bevacizumab in eoCRC relative to LoCRC patients (HR = 0.62 vs. HR = 0.82). Conclusions: Treatment naive eoCRC patients with metastatic disease derive similar benefit from bevacizumab relative to their average age counterparts.Age Group at Disease Onset (<50 vs. ≥50)Univariate AnalysisMultivariate Analysis1PFS HR (95% CI, p)1.04 (0.97-1.11, p=0.31)0.89 (0.52-1.51, p=0.65)OS HR (95% CI, p)0.98 (0.90-1.06, p=0.62)0.95 (0.51-1.75, p=0.86)1adjusted for PS, primary tumor sidedness, number of metastatic sites, liver/lung/lymph node/ peritoneal involvement, and KRAS and BRAF mutation status.',\n",

In this congress, we focus on the quality of life (QOL) assessments as a pre-planned analysis. (Study information: UMIN000015405). Methods: The C3 study was a randomized phase III study which evaluated the time to discontinuation of OX-containing therapy (sequential approach [Capecitabine/5-FU (FP)+Bmab followed by OX-FP+Bmab] vs. combination approach [OX-FP+Bmab]. The primary endpoint was TFS and secondary endpoints were ORR, OS, PFS, Safety and QoL. QOL assessments included European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaire for cancer (QLQ-C30) (EORTC QLQ C-30), EuroQol 5D 5L (EQ5D) and the Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) in both arm as a pre-planned analysis. Each questionnaire was collected at the time of enrolment, 6, 12, 18 months and end of treatment. QOL scores were compared using a mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM). Results: A total 292 patients participated in QoL part (arm A: n =148; arm B: n =144). The returned questionnaire sheets were 292 (reply rate: 97%), 206 (68%), 199 (65%), 61 (20%) at baseline, 6, 12, 18 months, respectively. Sequential approach was statistically improved than combination approach as follows: Physical functioning (p<0.001), Cognitive functioning (p=0.012), Social functioning (p=0.0004), and Fatigue (p=0.013) in EORTC QLQ C-30. In addition, at 6 months (after which attrition in the combination arm was more than 50%) after randomization, the mean change rate from baseline of EQ5D score in the sequential approach versus combination approach were: –1.91 (SD 27.57) versus –9.62 (29.60). In contract, PNQ sensory score showed that sequential approach was not statistically improved for combination approach (0.22 [SD: 0.89] vs. 0.61 [SD: 0.95], p=0.115). Conclusions: The further clarification of patients’ characteristics are needed, but this sequential approach can be advocated as a valuable treatment option in first-line mCRC for current guideline based on these QoLs and main efficacy data.',\n",

       "  '103Background: According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline, locally advanced rectal cancer is treated with chemotherapy with or without radiation, followed by transabdominal resection. However, there has been an emerging role for nonoperative management after chemoradiotherapy, and there is significant morbidity and risks associated with surgical resection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for rectal cancer, which is termed “salvage ESD,” may be a viable option for patients, in terms of evaluating pathological response and providing potential curative resection. We aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of salvage ESD. Methods: Retrospective chart review of cases of salvage ESD after CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer (salvage group) and standard ESD cases for rectal tumors without prior CRT (standard group) from July 2018 to August 2020 at our institution was performed. Clinical factors, imaging, procedural, and pathology results were collected and compared between the two groups. Results: 12 salvage ESD cases were compared to 27 standard ESD cases. 83.3% of the lesions in the salvage ESD group were initially staged as T3 prior to CRT. 100% of the lesions in the salvage ESD group were scarred down, compared to 33.3% in the standard ESD group (p <0.01). Technical outcomes are shown in the table. The en bloc resection rates were 92.7% and 91.7% (p=1.00) and R0 resection rates were 66.7% and 75.0% (p=0.55) for the standard and salvage groups, respectively. In the salvage ESD group, no adverse events were observed. 66.7% of the adenocarcinomas in the salvage ESD group had morphologically changed to hyperplasia or adenoma after CRT and there were no identifiable lesions greater than T1 staging. Conclusions: Salvage ESD after CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer is technically feasible and with comparable low complication rates. There may be a diagnostic role in salvage ESD in assessing pathological response to CRT, as well as a possibly therapeutic role in resection of residual lesions with the potential to avoid surgery. Further studies are underway comparing the clinical outcomes of salvage ESD with standard surgical resection after CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.Technical outcomes.N=33Standard ESD (N=27)Salvage ESD (N=12)p-valueEn Bloc Resection Rate25 (92.7%)11 (91.7%)1.00R0 Resection Rate18 (66.7%)9 (75.0%)0.55Complication rate2 (7.4%)0 (0%)0.50Hospital Length of Stay (days), Median (IQR)2.0 (0.0-3.0)1.0 (1.0-1.0)0.05HistologyHyperplasia0 (0%)1 (8.3%)0.14Tubular Adenoma5 (18.5%)5 (41.7%)Tubulovillous Adenoma11 (40.7%)2 (16.7%)Adenocarcinoma11 (40.7%)4 (33.3%)Post-ESD Tumor DepthTis2 (7.4%)1 (8.3%)T111 (40.7%)2 (16.7%)Missing data14 (51.8%)9 (75.0%)Residual Lesion or Recurrence Requiring Local Surgery1 (3.7%)2 (16.7%)0.22',\n",

       "  '104Background: The combination of anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR targeted drugs with chemotherapy is the standard first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and the followed maintenance treatment is an optional approach to balance the efficacy and toxicity. However, studies regarding the maintenance strategies based on antiangiogenic TKIs are limited currently. Anlotinib, a novel oral multi-target TKI which can inhibit both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation simultaneously, substantially prolonged the PFS with manageable toxicity for refractory mCRC in the phase III ALTER0703 clinical trial (NCT02332499). We present updated data from the study of anlotinib plus XELOX as first-line treatment followed by anlotinib monotherapy for mCRC. Methods: In this open label, single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical trial, 29 mCRC patients without prior systemic treated, aged 18-75 and an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were planned to recruit. Eligible patients received capecitabine (1000 mg/m2, po, d1-14, q3w) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2, iv, d1, q3w) plus anlotinib (10mg, po, d1̃14, q3w) treatment for 6 cycles. After 6 cycles of inducing therapy, patients would receive anlotinib (12mg, po, d1̃14, q3w) as maintenance therapy until disease progression or intolerable adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was PFS; Secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, DOR and safety. Results: At updated analysis (cutoff: Sep 10, 2021), a total of 27 patients were enrolled, of which 19 patients were available for efficacy assessment. In best overall response assessment, there were 63.2% PR (12/19), 26.3% SD (5/19) and 10.5% PD (2/19). The ORR was 63.2% (95% CI, 38.4-83.7%) and DCR was 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9-98.7%). One patient experienced the longest duration of treatment which was 17.5 months. The median PFS was not reached. The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade (≥25%) were leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, hypertension, neutropenia, hypohemoglobinemia, hypertriglyceridemia. Grade 3/4 TRAEs (≥10%) were neutropenia (14.8%), hypertension (14.8%) and hypertriglyceridemia (11.1%). One grade 5 TRAE was pancytopenia that occurred at 2.7 months. Conclusions: The update results suggested that anlotinib combined with XELOX as first line regimen followed by anlotinib monotherapy showed promising anti-tumor activity and manageable safety for patients with mCRC. And the conclusions needed to be confirmed in randomized studies. Clinical trial information: ChiCTR1900028417.',\n",

       "  '105Background: Recently, an increasing number of patients (pts) with advanced colorectal cancer tend to receive regorafenib plus PD-1 inhibitors. However, there is a lack of information regarding real world effects of this therapeutic strategy, especially in elderly Chinese pts. We aimed to investigate the treatment patterns, clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of regorafenib plus PD-1 inhibitors therapy to Chinese elderly pts with advanced colorectal cancer. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of pts with advanced colorectal cancer received treatment of regorafenib combined with PD-1 inhibitors enrolled in our institution between January 2019 and January 2021. Among them, pts with 60 years or older were included in our final analysis. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were estimated by Kaplan Meier curves, and other endpoints included objective response rate, prognostic factors. Results: At a median follow-up of 16.2 months, a total of 24 pts were enrolled in a real-world dataset from Henan Cancer Hospital. The median age was 68 years; 62.5% were female. The median OS and PFS were 15.03 months (95% CI 7.0-23.0) and 4.0 months (95% CI 1.8-6.2), respectively. 2/24 partial responses (PR) observed (ORR = 8.3%); Stable disease (SD) was obtained in 15/24. Disease control rate (PR plus SD) was therefore obtained in 17/24 (70.8%). When compared with PFS and OS in different initial daily doses group of regorafenib (such as ≤80, 120 or 160 mg), we concluded that there were no significantly difference between these groups. And similar results were found in final daily doses groups. However, it showed a trend toward better PFS in pts with ≥120 mg final daily doses group compared to <120 mg group (median PFS was 3.5 months in <120mg group versus 10.0 months in ≥120mg group). Median OS of pts for male gender demonstrated increasing trends compared with those female gender (20.2 months in males versus 13.2 months in females). Pts with previous treated with regorafenib had longer median OS than those without it (20.2 months versus 13.2 months). There were no obvious correlation for survival between pts only had liver metastasis and lung metastasis (P>0.05). No significant associations for survival could be seen in other tumor sites, K-RAS status, any kind of PD-1 inhibitors and whether previously treated with bevacizumab (P>0.05). Conclusions: This real-world dataset confirms that Chinese elderly pts with advanced colorectal cancer also can benefit from treatment of regorafenib combined with PD-1 inhibitors, similarly with this combination therapy strategies in all age pts. Furthermore, a longer survival time were obtained in pts with prior treated with regorafenib. The result also suggests that pts with ≥120mg final daily doses group had better PFS. However, further larger cohorts research should investigate whether the PFS advantage in high dose group could eventually lead to improved OS outcomes.',\n",

Results in a cohort of CRC pts with PIK3CA mutation treated with T are reported. Methods: Eligible pts had advanced CRC with PIK3CA mutation reported by a genomic test performed in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected lab, no standard treatment options, measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function. Use of T was approved by the TAPUR Molecular Tumor Board in each case. After antihistamine pre-treatment, T was administered at 25 mg IV over 30-60 minutes weekly until disease progression. Primary endpoint was disease control (DC), defined as complete (CR) or partial (PR) response per RECIST v. 1.1, or stable disease at 16+ weeks (SD 16+). Simon 2-stage design tested the null DC rate of 15% vs. 35% (power = 0.85; α = 0.10). If ≥2 of 10 pts in stage 1 has DC, 18 more pts are enrolled; otherwise, the study stops for futility.

Results in a cohort of CRC pts with hTMB treated with N+I are reported. Methods: Eligible pts had advanced CRC, no available standard treatment options, measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, adequate organ function and no prior immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. PDL-1 expression testing was not required. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. hTMB was defined a priori as ≥9 mutations/megabase (Muts/Mb) reported by a FoundationOne test (n=7) or other tests (n=5) if approved by the Molecular Tumor Board. Pts received N 1 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (wks) for 4 doses in combination with I 3 mg/kg every 3 wks for 4 doses. N was then continued at 240 mg every 2 wks or 480 mg every 4 wks until disease progression. Primary endpoint was disease control (DC), defined as complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, or stable disease at 16+ wks (SD 16+).

Results: 12 pts (9 male) with CRC with hTMB in tissue biopsy were enrolled from February 2018 to May 2020; 2 pts were not evaluable and excluded from efficacy analyses. All pts were evaluated for toxicity. TMB ranged from 9 to 233 Muts/Mb (median 13). Demographics and outcomes are summarized in the table below. Tumor microsatellite (MS) status was reported stable for 11 pts and indeterminate for 1 pt. 1 PR (88.1 wks duration, tumor 11 Muts/Mb, MS stable, PDL-1 expression not reported, KRAS mutant) and 0 pts with SD16+ were observed for a DC and OR rate of 10% (95% CI: 0%, 45%); the null DC rate of 15% was not rejected (p=0.80) and the cohort closed due to futility. 4 pts had at least one grade 3-4 adverse or serious adverse event (AE/SAE) at least possibly related to N+I including myasthenia gravis, diarrhea, glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, and small intestinal obstruction.

Methods: Patients with LARC from January 2018 to December 2020 receiving mFOLFIRINOX (5-Fluorouracil - 1800mg/m2 over 46 hours, Leucovorin 300mg, Irinotecan 135mg/m2, oxaliplatin 65mg/m2) post NACTRT/SCRT to facilitate curative local resection were evaluated. The primary endpoint was event free survival (EFS), where event was defined as disease progression or recurrence post resection after mFOLFIRINOX. Survivals were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Forty-seven patients were evaluated with a median age of 33 years (Range:18-59), 45% T4b status, 94% radiological circumferential margin (CRM) involved (79% CRM positive post NACTRT/SCRT), 43% extramural venous invasion (n=33) and 36% signet ring histology. 62% had received prior NACTRT and 38% had received SCRT with chemotherapy before receiving mFOLFIRINOX. The most common grade 3 and grade 4 treatment related side effects included diarrhoea (7%), anaemia (4%) and infections (4%). Intended duration of mFOLFIRINOX or beyond was completed in 94% of patients. 60% of patients underwent curative local resection with R0 resection rates of 100% (n=28) and pathological complete response rates of 21%. The most common surgeries done were exenterations and abdominoperineal resections in 22% and 17% patients respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, 25 patients had recurred or progressed for a median EFS of 20 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 15-24] while median overall survival was 55 months (95% CI: 24-86). Conclusions: Locally advanced rectal cancers with high-risk characteristics are a niche group of cancers with less-than-optimal outcomes post standard neoadjuvant strategies. mFOLFIRINOX appears to be well tolerated in this cohort of patients and enables conversion to curative local resection and potentially improves survival as well.',\n",

       "  '109Background: Triplet regimen, FOLFOXIRI, combined with bevacizumab (bev) or panitumumab has been shown to be superior in terms of early tumor shrinkage and depth of response (DpR) compared to doublet combinations in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We performed a randomized phase II study, DEEPER trial (JACCRO CC-13)[NCT02515734], to investigate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab (cet) vs. bevacizumab (bev) in combination with modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, 5-FU 2400 mg/m2) in previously untreated mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors (Tsuji A, et\\xa0al. ASCO 2021). Methods: The primary endpoint was DpR during the entire course. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate, R0 resection rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. A post-hoc subgroup analysis by PS, tumor sidedness, age, and location of metastases was performed to evaluate the efficacy of triplet plus cet vs. bev regimen. Results: A total of 359 patients were enrolled between July 2015 and June 2019. For the full analysis set (median age 65y, 64% male, PS0/1: 91%/9%, left/right primary: 83%/17%), 173 and 175 patients were randomly assigned to the cet and bev arms, respectively. Median DpR was 57.4% vs. 46.0% (p = 0.001), and the ORR was 69.1% vs. 71.7% (p = 0.60), in cet vs. bev, respectively. The subgroup analysis was present in the table. There was no significant difference in terms of ORR and R0 resection rate between groups according to PS, tumor sidedness, age, and liver metastases (LM). In patients with only LM, the R0 resection rate of cet vs. bev was 25.0% vs. 14.8% (p = 0.21). Conclusions: The m-FOLFOXIRI plus cet showed to be significantly superior to the m-FOLFOXIRI plus bev in terms of DpR in first-line treatment for RAS wild-type mCRC. The better DpR of m-FOLFOXIRI plus cet was evident for RAS wild-type mCRC patients with left-sided tumors, LM or under 70 years old.

       "  '110Background: Single agent selinexor, an oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), showed activity against heavily pretreated CRC with RAS mutations (mut) or wildtype (wt) in 2 clinical studies. In preclinical studies, selinexor showed superior potency in KRAS mut over wt with improved activity in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. A phase 1b study (NCT02419495) showed the safety and antitumor activity of combined selinexor and a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. This phase 1/2 open-label study is evaluating selinexor with pembrolizumab in patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-stable CRC. Methods: The study enrolled patients with advanced/metastatic CRC who progressed after prior chemotherapy (1-3 lines for RAS wt, 1-2 for RAS mut) and are ineligible for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Patients received weekly oral selinexor 80 mg and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. Antitumor activity, safety and tolerability were assessed. Results: Thirty-four patients, median age 57.5 years, male 59%, RAS mut 53%, median prior lines 2, are enrolled. At data cutoff (1-SEP-21) median treatment duration was 57 days (range: 1-246) and 25 patients were evaluable for response. Best response was stable disease in 8/13 patients with RAS mut CRC (62%) and in 3/12 patients with RAS wt CRC (25%). Median overall survival (months) has not been reached for the overall population (95% CI: 6.3, NE), for RAS mut (95% CI: 7.6, NE), and for the RAS wt (95% CI: 6.1, NE). Median progression-free survival is 3.0 and 1.4 months for patients with CRC with RAS mut and wt, respectively (p=0.04; HR: 0.43 [959% CI: 0.18, 1.01]). Thirty patients (88%) discontinued therapy, mostly due to progressive disease (44%). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (total; Grade ≥3) were nausea (77%; 3%), vomiting (41%; 0%), fatigue (41%; 12%), decreased appetite (35%; 0%), diarrhea (32%; 0%). Nine patients (26%) had serious treatment-emergent adverse events. Conclusions: Combined selinexor with pembrolizumab demonstrated higher disease control rates and prolonged overall survival in patients with chemotherapy-refractory advanced/metastatic CRC with RAS mut vs RAS wt tumors. These patients would not have been eligible for anti-PD-1 mAb therapy because their tumors were not MSI-high, suggesting that the combination may be active in RAS mut CRC. Therapy was well tolerated with no unanticipated adverse events. Further investigation of this combined treatment is warranted, particularly in patients with CRC with RAS mut.

       "  '111Background: Appropriate tissue tension and clear visibility of the dissection area using traction are essential for effective and safe endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We developed a robotic assistive traction device for colonoscopy.This is a preclinical animal study to evaluate the performance of colorectal ESD using novel robotic system. Methods: Experienced endoscopist performed ESD on ex vivo porcine colon ten times using a robot and ten times by the conventional method. The outcome measures were operating time (from starting incision to finishing dissection), completeness of resection, procedure-related adverse events, and limitations of arm manipulation in a narrow working space as assessed by counting the frequency of blind cutting.We also conducted an in\\xa0vivo feasibility study on live pig. Results: Total of twenty colonic lesions were resected from ex vivo porcine colon. The submucosal dissection speed was significantly faster in robotic ESD than in conventional ESD (P = 0.002). Adverse events such as perforation were also significantly higher in the conventional group. In the in\\xa0vivo feasibility study, robot was attached to the colonoscope and inserted into the proximal colon. ESD was performed successfully. Conclusions: When the robot was assisting in the ESD procedure, the dissection speed improved significantly. Our robotic device can thus provide simple, effective, and safe multidirectional traction during colonic ESD.',\n",

We therefore investigated the efficacy and safety of RAM plus FOLFIRI as second-line treatment in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy with anti-EGFR antibody. Methods: The JACCRO CC-16 was a multicenter, phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RAM (8 mg/kg) plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m2, bolus 5-FU 400 mg/m2, infusional 5-FU 2400 mg/m2) in mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors and ECOG PS 0 or 1, after first-line doublet or triplet plus anti-EGFR antibody therapy. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), early tumor shrinkage (ETS), and safety. We hypothesized a threshold 6-month PFS rate of 30% and an expected 6-month PFS rate of 45% for the protocol treatment. A sample size of 74 patients was required (one-sided α, 0.05; β, 0.2). Results: A total of 92 patients were enrolled between October 2018 and December 2020. Ninety-one patients, excluding one ineligible patient, were analyzed as the full analysis set: median age 66.0-y (range, 29–84), 46% female, 81% ECOG PS 0, 40% with primary tumor, 95% left-sided (rectum, sigmoid or descending colon) primary tumors, 70%/42% with liver/lung metastases. In prior first-line treatment, 19 (21%) patients were treated with triplet plus anti-EGFR antibody. The median number of treatment cycles was 10 (range, 1–56). Primary endpoint was met; at data cut-off, with 76 events, 6-month PFS rate was 58.2% (95% CI; 47.4-67.6). The median PFS was 7.0 months. The ORR, disease control rate, and ETS were 10.7%, 86.9%, and 16.9%, respectively. In the safety population of 92 patients, any grade adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (75%), hypertension (59%), proteinuria (34%), and diarrhea (33%). Grade 3-4 AEs were neutropenia (48%), hypertension (27%), proteinuria (4%), diarrhea (3%), and febrile neutropenia (3%). No treatment-related death was observed. Conclusions: This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that RAM plus FOLFIRI as second-line treatment has favorable PFS rate and tolerability after anti-EGFR antibody containing chemotherapy in RAS wild-type mCRC patients.

       "  '113Background: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery has been widely adopted as the standard treatment for stage II-III rectal cancers. However, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in pathological T3N0M0 (pT3N0M0) patients remains controversial. A reliable prognostic model is needed to discriminate the high-risk patients from the low-risk patients, and optimize adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions by predicting the likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit for the target population. Methods: We gathered and analyzed 276 patients in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center from March 2005 to December 2011. All patients underwent total mesorectal excision, without preoperative therapy, and were pathologically proven pT3N0M0 rectal cancer. LASSO regression model was used for variable selection and risk factor prediction. Multivariable cox regression was used to develop the predicting model. Optimum cut-off values were determined using X-Tile plot analysis. The 10-fold cross validation was adopted to validate the model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated with its calibration, discrimination and clinical usefulness. Results: A total of 188 patients (68.1%) had adjuvant chemotherapy and no patients had adjuvant radiotherapy. Age, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA199], monocyte percentage [MONO%], lymph node dissection numbers [LNDs] and nerve invasion were identified as significantly associated variables that could be combined for an accurate prediction risk of CSS for pT3N0M0 patients. The model adjusted for CSS showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.723 (95% CI = 0.652 to 0.794). The calibration curves showed that the nomogram adjusted for CSS was able to predict 3-, 5-, and 10-year CSS accurately. The corresponding predicted probability was used to stratify high and low-risk patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival rate in the low-risk patients (HR = 0.338, 95% CI: 0.135 to 0.848, P = 0.021), while it did not exhibit a significant benefit in the high-risk patients. Conclusions: The nomogram effectively predicts CSS in patients with pT3N0M0 rectal cancer, which can be conveniently used in clinical practice. Adjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival in the low-risk patients. But the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not seen in the high-risk patients.',\n",

Secondary endpoints included time to deterioration of quality of life (TTDQoL). Methods: EPOCH was a 1:1 randomized, open-label, global, multicenter phase 3 trial. TTDQoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-colorectal (FACT-c) questionnaire and defined as the time from randomization to the change from baseline in FACT-c total score ≤ -7 points or date of death and was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Time to subsequent therapy was defined as the time from randomization to the start of subsequent therapy and was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was used to estimate the area under Kaplan-Meier curves (AUC) for progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS), and TTDQoL, and the difference in AUC estimates between the two arms were assessed. The use of TheraSphere in the USA in the trial was under Investigational Device Exemption from FDA. Results: The EPOCH trial included 428 patients. Both primary endpoints of PFS (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.88; 1-sided p=0.0013) and hPFS (HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.77; 1-sided p<0.0001) were met in the EPOCH study. Median time to subsequent therapy in the TARE plus chemotherapy arm was 21.0 months, compared to 10.1 months in the chemotherapy only arm (HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.67). TTDQoL before subsequent therapy was reported in 53.5% (115/215) patients in the TARE plus chemotherapy arm, compared to 43.7% of patients in the chemotherapy only arm (93/213). Median TTDQoL was 3.8 months in both the TARE plus chemotherapy arm and the chemotherapy alone arm (1-sided p=0.1513; HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.14). AUC for PFS until 22.1 months was 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.4, 10.4) for the TARE plus chemotherapy arm, compared to 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.6, 8.1) for the chemotherapy only arm (1-sided p=0.0008). AUC for hPFS until 22.1 months was 10.3 months (95% CI: 9.2, 11.3) for the TARE plus chemotherapy arm, compared to 7.4 months (95% CI: 6.7, 8.2) for the chemotherapy only arm (1-sided p<0.0001). AUC for TTDQoL until 18.5 months was 6.6 (95% CI: 5.6, 7.6) for the TARE plus chemotherapy arm, compared to 5.5 (95% CI: 4.4, 6.5) for the chemotherapy only arm (1-sided p=0.0663). Conclusions: These results suggest that the addition of TARE to second-line chemotherapy in patients with liver-dominant mCRC extended PFS, hPFS, and time to subsequent treatment without compromising quality of life.

       "  '115Background: The EPOCH trial evaluated potential benefit of second-line transarterial radioembolization (TARE) plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with liver-dominant metastatic colorectal disease (mCRC). Presented here are additional results from EPOCH of depth and duration of response (DoR), and progression-free survival (PFS) and hepatic progression-free survival (hPFS) subgroup analyses. Methods: EPOCH was a 1:1 randomized, open-label, global, multicenter phase 3 trial of second-line chemotherapy for liver-dominant mCRC comparing outcomes from chemotherapy with or without unilobar or same-day bilobar TARE treatment using glass microspheres. Primary study endpoints were PFS and hPFS. Pre-specified subgroup analyses of PFS and hPFS were performed. PFS, hPFS, DoR for patients with objective response, and depth of response (percent change from baseline to nadir in sum of longest diameters of target lesions) were based on blinded, independent central review using RECIST 1.1. The use of TheraSphere in the trial in the USA was under Investigational Device Exemption from FDA. Results: Both primary endpoints of PFS (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.88; 1-sided p=0.0013) and hPFS (HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.77; 1-sided p<0.0001) were met in the EPOCH study. Median DoR in the 73 responders of the TARE arm was numerically longer, with 7.2 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis; in the 45 responders of the chemotherapy only arm, 6.6 months (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.30; 1-sided p = 0.178). Mean depth of response across all patients in the TARE arm with data available (N=196) was -25.6%, compared to -13.0% in the chemotherapy only arm (N=182; mean difference -12.6 percentage points; 95% CI: -18.9, -6.3; 1-sided p = 0.0001). Key subgroups of interest which showed improved PFS and/or hPFS in the TARE arm (ie, 95% CI for the HR entirely below 1) are as follows: Conclusions: These data suggest that liver-dominant mCRC patients in this trial benefitted in second-line treatment from a combination of TARE plus chemotherapy based upon improved PFS and hPFS over the full set of patients and in a number of subgroups. The addition of TARE to chemotherapy improves depth of response compared to chemotherapy alone.

       "  '116Background: Constitutively activating KRAS or NRAS muts occur in ̃50% of CRC, increasing RAF-MEK-ERK signaling and causing overexpression of cyclin D1, which binds to cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) to drive cell cycle progression. Combination MEK and CDK4/6 inhibitors caused tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts of KRAS mut CRC. We hypothesized that binimetinib and palbociclib (B+P) would improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to TAS-102 in refractory KRAS/NRAS mut mCRC. Methods: ACCRU-GI-1618 was a multicenter, randomized phase II clinical trial (NCT03981614). Key inclusion criteria were KRAS/NRAS mut mCRC, with prior fluoropyrimidine/ oxaliplatin/ irinotecan/ anti-VEGF therapy. There was a 6-patient safety run-in with binimetinib 30 mg po BID D1-28 and palbociclib 100 mg po daily D1-21. After, patients were randomized 1:1 to B+P vs TAS-102 (stratified by KRAS mut type and prior regorafenib use), with optional crossover at progression. The primary endpoint was PFS; 73 PFS events (from a sample size of 112) provided 90% power to detect improvement of PFS (hazard ratio = 0.5, i.e. median PFS of 2 vs. 4 months) with 1-sided α = 0.05. A prespecified interim analysis for futility was planned after 37 PFS events were observed, with completion of accrual if 1-sided stratified log-rank p-value < 0.551. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are estimated by stratified Cox proportional hazards models. Results: After the safety run-in, 93 patients at 6 sites were randomized; 82 (41 B+P, 41 TAS-102) comprise the primary analysis population (eligible, consented, and started treatment). In this population, median age was 52 years, 50% female, 68% left-sided, 79% with KRAS codon 12/13 mut, 12% with prior regorafenib. Enrollment was halted at interim analysis as the futility boundary was crossed (1-sided p = 0.67). At final analysis, 68 subjects had a PFS event (34 in each arm). Median PFS was 2.1 mo (95% CI 2.0-3.0) with B+P vs 2.1 mo (2.0-2.4) with TAS-102; HR 0.86 (0.52-1.44). 4-mo PFS rate was 22.2% (11.9-41.6) with B+P vs 10.6% (3.8-30.0) with TAS-102. With 37 OS events (14 in B+P arm), median OS was 7.7 mo (5.1-NE) with B+P vs 6.6 mo (4.8-8.9) with TAS-102; HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.39-1.51). TAS-102 had greater grade 3-4 hematologic AEs (46% vs 22%), and B+P had more grade 3-4 non-hematologic AEs (47% vs 32%). Grade 3-4 AEs more common with B+P were fatigue (8% vs 0%), oral mucositis (6% vs 0%), and nausea (4% vs 2%). Though 63% of patients on B+P had acneiform rash, only 2% was grade 3-4. Grade 1-2 diarrhea occurred in 35% of B+P and 24% of TAS-102 patients. No new safety signal was observed. Conclusions: B+P did not significantly improve median PFS or OS compared to TAS-102 in KRAS/NRAS mut mCRC. Subgroup analyses and translational studies are ongoing to determine which subgroups may be more likely to attain 4-mo PFS or identify mechanisms of resistance.

       "  '117Background: The benefit of adding Oxaliplatin to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC) patients remains controversial. The present study investigated whether induction chemotherapy (CapOX), 2 cycles of CapOX combined with standard radiation (Oxa-CRT) concurrently and consolidation chemotherapy (CapOX) could improve OS compared with standard treatment (nCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer. Methods: We conducted this randomized, single center, open-label, phase III trial in China. Eligible patients were pathologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma, clinical T3-4 with or without regional N + and no sign of distance metastasis determined by pelvic MRI, chest and abdominal CT scan. All patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group: pelvic radiation of 50Gy/25 fractions with 4 cycles of oxaliplatin and capecitabine (1 cycle of CapOX (oxaliplatin: 130mg/m2, cape: 1000mg/m2, bid, Day 1 to Day 14) administrated before radiotherapy as induction chemotherapy, 2 cycles of CapOX (oxaliplatin: 100mg/m2, cape: 1000mg/m2, bid, Day 1 to Day 14) administrated concurrent with RT, and 1 cycle of CapOX (oxaliplatin: 130mg/m2, cape: 1000mg/m2, bid, Day 1 to Day 14) conducted as consolidation chemotherapy); or control group: radiation with capecitabine. The primary end point was OS. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02031939). Results: From January 2014 to June 2020, 556 patients enrolled in this study (n=278 in both groups), and 536 patients were evaluable (269 in experimental group and 267 patients in control group). Surgery was performed in 235 patients (84.5%) in experimental group and 242 patients (87.1%) in control group. The pCR rates were 27.8% (75 in 269) and 19.4% in control group (52 in 267) (p = 0.025). 16 and 5 patients achieved clinical complete response (cCR) in experimental and control group, respectively. Grade 3-4 toxicities were recorded in 42 (21.8%) and 6 (5.1%) patients in experimental and control group. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The overall surgical complication rate was not significantly different between two groups (12.1% vs. 11.9%). Conclusions: Four cycles of CapOX combined with RT in LARC significantly increased complete tumor response in Chinese patients with acceptable toxicities.

       "  '118Background: To date, immune-checkpoint inhibition for microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRC has been ineffective, though targeted therapy combination strategies may be promising. This phase II, investigator-initiated trial (NCT03475004) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the three-drug combination of pembrolizumab (pembro), binimetinib, and bevacizumab in patients with advanced, MSS treatment-refractory colorectal cancer. Methods: Patients with mCRC locally determined to be MSS and whom have progressed on two prior lines of therapy were enrolled. Treatment consists of pembro (200 mg every 3 weeks), binimetinib (45 mg BID) and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is PFS using RECIST v1.1 by investigator review. Additional endpoints include objective response rate, disease control rate at time of first re-staging (2 mo), duration of response, and safety and tolerability. Results: 50 patients have been enrolled (accrual is completed). 53% of patients are male and the mean age is 53.6 (range 31-79). The mean number of prior therapies is 5.3. At the time of preliminary data review, 39 patients are evaluable for response data. The median PFS was 5.8 mo (95% CI 4.2 to 8.9). The objective response rate was 13% with 5 partial responses. 24 patients (62%) had stable disease and 10 (26%) had progressive disease as the best response. The disease control rate at the time of first re-staging was 74%. Median duration of response was 6.5 mo. 19 (40%) patients experienced serious adverse events; the most common grade ≥3 adverse events included transaminase elevation (15%), diarrhea (11%), acneiform rash (9%), hypertension (9%), and anemia (9%). Conclusions: Preliminary results from this phase II study indicate that this regimen of pembrolizumab, binimetinib, and bevacizumab has promising activity and acceptable tolerability in this heavily pre-treated population of patients with MSS metastatic colorectal cancer. Final results will be presented as well as ongoing correlative studies. Clinical trial information: NCT03475004.',\n",

       "  '119Background: T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate of a humanized anti-HER2 antibody bound to a topoisomerase I inhibitor by a cleavable linker. The primary analysis of DESTINY-CRC01 (DS8201-A-J203; NCT03384940), a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study of T-DXd in pts with HER2-expressing mCRC showed promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile (cohort A median follow-up [FU], 27.1 weeks; Siena S, ASCO 2020). We present updated longer-term efficacy and safety data. Methods: Pts had centrally confirmed HER2-expressing, RAS wild-type mCRC that progressed after ≥2 prior regimens. 6.4 mg/kg of T-DXd was administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) in 3 cohorts (A: HER2 IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+; B: IHC2+/ISH−; C: IHC1+). The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review in cohort A. Secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR; CR + PR + SD), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: At data cutoff (Dec 28, 2020), 86 pts (A, 53; B, 15; C, 18) received T-DXd. Median age was 58.5 y (range, 27-79), 53.5% were male, and 90.7% had left colon or rectum cancer. Median prior regimens for metastatic disease was 4 (range, 2-11). All pts had prior irinotecan; 30.2% in cohort A had prior anti-HER2 therapy. Median (m) treatment duration (all pts) was 3.0 mo (95% CI, 2.1-4.1; cohort A, 5.1 mo [95% CI, 3.9-7.6]). In cohort A (median FU, 62.4 weeks), confirmed ORR was 45.3% (24/53 pts; 95% CI, 31.6-59.6), DCR was 83.0% (44/53 pts; 95% CI, 70.2-91.9), mDOR was 7.0 mo (95% CI, 5.8-9.5), mPFS was 6.9 mo (95% CI, 4.1-8.7) with 37 (69.8%) PFS events, and mOS was 15.5 mo (95% CI, 8.8-20.8) with 36 (67.9%) OS events. These results are consistent with the primary analysis. Confirmed ORR was 43.8% (7/53 pts; 95% CI, 19.8-70.1) for pts with prior anti-HER2 therapy, 57.5% (23/53 pts; 95% CI, 40.9-73.0) for pts with IHC3+ status, and 7.7% (1/53 pts; 95% CI, 0.2-36.0) for pts with IHC2+/ISH+ status. In cohorts B and C, mPFS was 2.1 mo (95% CI, 1.4-4.1) and 1.4 mo (95% CI, 1.3-2.1); mOS was 7.3 mo (95% CI, 3.0-NE) and 7.7 mo (95% CI, 2.2-13.9), respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of grade (G) ≥3 occurred in 65.1% of pts (56/86); the most common TEAEs were hematologic and gastrointestinal. TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation occurred in 13 pts (15.1%). 8 pts (9.3%) had interstitial lung disease (ILD) adjudicated by an independent committee as related to T-DXd (4 G2; 1 G3; 3 G5). Conclusions: T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg Q3W showed promising activity and durability with longer-term FU in pts with HER2-expressing mCRC. The safety profile was consistent with prior results; ILD continues to be an important identified risk that requires careful monitoring and intervention as needed. These results support continued exploration of T-DXd in this patient population. Clinical trial information: NCT03384940.',\n",

       "  '120Background: Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) is a liver directed therapy to treat unresectable or resected colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Historically, HAI has only been performed at few specialized centers; however, there is increasing expansion to new centers. We previously reported safety outcomes of our index year of HAI therapy. We now report safety, feasibility, efficacy and oncologic outcomes for an expanded cohort of 62 patients in an established HAI program. Methods: Patients selected for HAI by multidisciplinary review were evaluated for demographics and perioperative outcomes. Objective hepatic response was calculated according to RECIST 1.1. Overall, hepatic and extrahepatic progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method on an intent-to-treat basis. Results: 62 patients were treated with HAI from November 2018-September 2021: 46 for unresectable CRLM, 8 as adjuvant HAI for resected CRLM, and 8 for unresectable ICC. Median age was 54.5 years (range 32-80), 58% were male, and 97% received prior chemotherapy (median 12 cycles, range 0-66). Hepatectomy (18, 29%) and/or colectomy/proctectomy (27, 43.5%) was performed concurrently with pump placement, and 19 (30.6%) were performed robotically. Median operating time was 265 minutes (range 130-526), estimated blood loss was 100 mL (range 22-1000) and length of stay was 5 days (range 1-19). HAI-specific complications occurred in 14% (Table). Floxuridine (FUDR) was initiated in 95% of patients a median of 18.5 days after surgery. Of the 38 patients who received HAI for unresectable CRLM and had measurable disease on imaging, 3- and 6-month hepatic disease control was achieved in 86% (8 partial response [PR], 22 stable disease [SD], 5 progressed [PD]) and 89% (1 complete response, 8 PR, 8 SD, 2 PD), respectively. For patients with at least 3 months follow-up, median PFS, hepatic PFS and extrahepatic PFS were 13 months, 13 months, and 13 months, respectively. Conclusions: HAI can be safely and effectively delivered to well-selected patients with CRLM and ICC. Response rates, disease control and PFS in heavily treated patients with unresectable CRLM comparable to high-volume centers can be achieved at new programs with appropriate expertise. These data support the mission of the newly formed HAI Consortium to critically evaluate efficacy and innovation in HAI therapy through multi-institutional collaboration and contemporary prospective trials.HAI-Specific ComplicationsPerioperative Complications< 30 days (n, %)Late Complications> 30 days (n, %)None51 (84%)49 (79%)HAI pocket seroma/hematoma4 (7%)2 (3%)HAI pocket infection1 (2%)2 (3%)Pump Migration/Erosion02 (3%)Arterial thrombosis/dissection2 (3%)0Catheter dislodgement/Separation03 (5%)Arterial pseudoaneurysm01 (2%)Extrahepatic perfusion2 (3%)0Biliary Sclerosis04 (7%)',\n",

       "  '121Background: Cabozantinib, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, promotes an immune-permissive environment which may enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. COSMIC-021 (NCT03170960) is evaluating the combination of cabozantinib with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Outcomes in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy are presented. Methods: Pts with mCRC and an ECOG PS of 0–1 who progressed during or following systemic chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan were eligible. Up to 2 prior lines of anti-cancer therapy including EGFR-targeted therapy were allowed. Microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) and/or mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient pts were excluded. Pts received cabozantinib 40 mg PO QD plus atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by investigator. Other endpoints included safety, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). CT/MRI scans were performed Q6W for the first year and Q12W thereafter. Results: 31 pts received cabozantinib plus atezolizumab (median age, 60 y [range 31, 79]; male, 58%; ECOG PS 1, 61%; 2 prior lines of therapy, 71%; prior EGFR inhibitor, 16%; ≥3 tumor sites, 52%; tumors in left colorectum, 71%). Median follow-up was 28.1 mo (range, 24.2, 31.3) as of July 21, 2021. Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in pts with mCRC (Table). Patients with wild-type RAS (n = 12) had numerically longer PFS and OS and higher ORR vs those with mutations (n = 19) (Table). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 28 (90%); the most common were diarrhea (52%), fatigue (42%), and nausea (35%). Grade 3-4 TRAEs occurred in 16 (52%); the most common were hypertension (10%), fatigue (6%), and lipase increased (6%); no Grade 5 events were reported. Conclusions: Cabozantinib plus atezolizumab demonstrated encouraging clinical activity with manageable toxicity in pts with previously treated advanced non-MSI-H/MMR-proficient CRC.

       "  '123Background: Although cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been available for over a decade, the pattern of tumor volume change in rectal dancer during preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has been under the veil due to poor soft tissue contrast of registration CBCT. This study was conducted to investigate daily rectal tumor volume change using registration magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Patients diagnosed with cT3-4 and/or cN+ rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing preoperative CCRT with capecitabine on the pelvis up to 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions from November 2018 to June 2019 were consecutively included. Rectal tumor volume was uniformly measured by single physician (YKK) in daily 0.35T MRI obtained with ViewRay MRIdian Linac (ViewRay Inc., Oakwood, USA). The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of daily tumor volume (cc), difference of tumor volume between first fraction and daily fraction (daily tumor volume – baseline tumor volume at first fraction), and tumor volume reduction rate (%, (daily tumor volume – baseline tumor volume at first fraction)/baseline tumor volume at first fraction x 100) were calculated. Statistical significance of differences were tested using the Wilcoxon’s signed rank test and paired t-test. Results: Thirteen patients were included. Median age was 65 and majority of the patients were male (92.3%). Most tumors were T3 (76.9%) and N1-2 (92.3%). Tumors were located median 6 cm (range: 2.4 – 9) above anal verge. Median follow-up was 27.3 months (range: 11.7 – 30.6) and 2 patients had recurred at the time of analysis (1 local and 1 distant). Tumor volume steadily regressed with daily administration of CCRT (mean 2.06 +/-1.73 cc; Figure 1). Significant tumor volume reduction compared to baseline was observed from fourth fraction (mean -12.37 +/- 16.72 cc; P < 0.0005). The difference of tumor volume between baseline and the last fraction was mean -49.33 +/- 68.13 cc (P < 0.0002). The tumor volume reduction rate was significantly increased since fourth fraction (mean - 17.2 +/- 11.78 %; P < 0.0002). The tumor volume reduction rate at the last fraction was - 70.62 +/- 14.01 % (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: For the first time, this study demonstrated daily tumor volume regression in preoperative rectal CCRT with capecitabine using daily MRI. Steady pattern of tumor regression may be explained in part by daily administration of capecitabine. Based on the hypothesis-generating observation, this study may warrant initiation of further investigations such as analysis and comparison with daily tumor volume regression with CCRT using leucovorin and 5-FU.',\n",

       "  '124Background: Cancer patients undergoing surgical resection of their tumor are hypercoagulable beyond the period of hospitalization. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the postoperative hypercoagulable state promotes metastases, an effect that is abrogated by administration of perioperative low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). Methods: We conducted a randomized, open label clinical trial to determine if extended duration thromboprophylaxis using subcutaneous LMWH (tinzaparin 4,500 IU daily), beginning at decision to operate and continuing for 56 days postoperatively, compared to inpatient postoperative thromboprophylaxis only, increased the 3-year disease-free survival (DSF) in patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer. Secondary outcomes included 5-year overall survival (OS), postoperative bleeding and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Results: Trial recruitment was stopped prematurely after 614 of the planned 1075 patients were registered, following a pre-defined interim analysis for futility. The intention-to-treat analysis included 602 patients with demographics in the table. The 3-year DFS was 78.9% (63/299 recurrences) in the tinzaparin group and 80.5% (59/303 recurrences) in the control group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; [95% CI 0.91,1.31; p=0.3]). The 5-year OS was 91.3% in the tinzaparin group and 92.4% in the control group (HR 1.08; [95% CI 0.66,1.79; p=0.1]). The incidence of postoperative VTE was 1.7% and 1.3% in the tinzaparin and control groups, respectively (HR 1.3; [95% CI 0.30,5.69; p=0.7]. The incidence of major bleeding in the first postoperative week was 0.3% and 2% in the tinzaparin and control groups, respectively (HR 0.16; [95% CI 0.02,1.15; p=0.07]. Conclusions: Extended duration perioperative anticoagulation with tinzaparin did not improve DFS or OS in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgical resection.

       "  '125Background: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy (PIPAC) is being evaluated as a novel minimally invasive palliative treatment of peritoneal metastases (PM). Prior studies have established the feasibility and safety of repeated PIPAC treatments in gastrointestinal and gynecologic cancers. The goal of the present phase 1 trial was to establish the safety and feasibility of PIPAC oxaliplatin in a highly chemotherapy refractory colorectal and appendiceal cancer patient population. Methods: Patients with biopsy-proven peritoneal metastases from colorectal or appendiceal cancer underwent up to three PIPAC treatments using oxaliplatin (92 mg/m2) with a six-week interval at two academic centers. Patients with bowel obstruction, extra-peritoneal metastases, or poor performance status (ECOG>2) were excluded. PIPAC was nebulized over 5 min with a 30 min aerosol dwell time. Apart from the first PIPAC cycle, the patients also received a sensitizing dose of 5FU/LV (400mg/m2) within 24 hours of the procedure. Primary end point was safety as assessed by dose limiting toxicities within 6 weeks of the first PIPAC. Secondary endpoints included safety with the addition of 5FU/LV, efficacy, surgical morbidity, technical failure rate, progression-free and overall survival, pharmacokinetics (PK), and quality of life assessment. Results: A total of 8 patients were included: 5 colorectal; and 3 appendiceal. Median number of prior chemotherapy cycles was 2 (Interquartile range – IQR; 1.5-3.5). All patients were refractory to systemic oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Median time from diagnosis to PIPAC was 16 months (IQR; 5.6, 17.5) and Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index was 29 (IQR; 20.5, 31.5). Five (62.5%) patients completed 3 PIPAC cycles while in 3 (37.5%) patients PIPAC was discontinued due to disease progression within the peritoneal cavity. No surgical complication or dose limiting toxicity was observed. Only one patient developed grade 3 treatment-related toxicity after first PIPAC (anemia), and another patient after second PIPAC (abdominal pain and anemia). At the completion of PIPAC treatment 5 patients had stable disease and 3 had disease progression. Pharmacokinetic, histologic response and preliminary survival data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: PIPAC with oxaliplatin is safe and feasible in a highly chemotherapy refractory cohort of appendiceal and colorectal carcinomatosis patients with or without sensitizing 5-FU/ LV.

       "  '126Background: This study reports our long-term experience with high dose rate intraoperative radiotherapy (HDR-IORT) in a single, quaternary institution. Methods: From 2004-2020, 138 consecutive patients with 141 total resections for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) (n=60, 43%) defined as T4Nx or T3N+ or locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) (n=81, 57%) were retrospectively reviewed. The median age was 61 years (range 31-83) with 30 patients aged >70 years during surgery. Most patients had preoperative radiotherapy (RT) +/- concurrent chemotherapy (n=125). Thirty-two recurrent cancers received preoperative pelvic reirradiation to a median dose of 36 Gy (range 34.2 – 41.4). HDR-IORT was delivered using isotope iridium-192 in a remote afterloader, and a Freiburg applicator, after macroscopic resection of the tumour. A single 10 Gy fraction was delivered. Fifty-eight of 84 patients who underwent pelvic exenterations had >3 en bloc organs resected, and 96 patients underwent pelvic sidewall dissections. IORT sites included the primary tumour bed (33%), nodal regions (28%) and wider pelvic areas (70%). Resection margin status were R0 in 76 patients (54%) and R1 in 65 (46%). R1 resection was defined as positive (n=53) or close (n=12). R1 resection patients accounted for 61% of pelvic relapses. Results: With a median follow-up time of 4 years, 3-, 5-, and 7- year, overall survival (OS) rates were 75%, 48%, and 45%, respectively (84%,58%, 58% for LARC and 68%,39%, 35% for LRRC). Local progression-free survival (LPFS) of all patients were 88%, 85%, and 85%, respectively (97%, 93%, 93% for LARC and 80%, 80%, 80% for LRRC). On multivariable analysis, an R1 resection was associated with a trend toward poorer OS (p=0.05), while a trend towards worse LPFS (p=0.07) was noted for those without preoperative RT. The most common severe (grade ≥3) adverse events were postoperative abscess (n=25) and bowel obstruction (n=11). Overall, there were 49 (34%) grade 3-4 and no grade 5 adverse events. No intraoperative complications were attributed to IORT. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. Conclusions: Favorable OS and LPFS can be achieved with intensive local therapy. As R1 resection may be associated with worse survival, optimisation of IORT, surgical resection, and systemic therapy are required.

       "  '127Background: Oxaliplatin in association with fluoropyrimidines is universally considered one of the most effective drugs for colorectal cancer and the mainstay of front-line treatment of metastatic patients. In contrast the efficacy and safety profile of oxaliplatin based regimens in the late-care treatment space have been poorly and conflictingly reported. Methods: We identified a real-world cohort of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients undergoing repeated oxaliplatin treatments in a single institution and retrospectively analysed their clinicopathological features to identify potential efficacy-predictive determinants of oxaliplatin response at retreatment (RETROX-CRC Study). Results: Out of 2,606 consecutive mCRC patients referred to Niguarda Cancer Center, 119 fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the study. The response rate (RR) and the disease control rate (DCR) after oxaliplatin retreatments were respectively 21.6% (95% CI 14.4-31.0%), and 57.8% (95% CI 47.7-67.4). A trend towards better RR and DCR was observed among patients who were exposed to oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting, while a significantly poorer outcome was observed when two or more intervening treatments were delivered in between oxaliplatin exposures. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months (95% CI 4.3-6.1), significantly lower if oxaliplatin was re-administered beyond the third line (HR 2.02; 1.25-3.25; p=0.004). Safety data were reliably retrieved in 65 patients (54,6%). Of these 18.5% (12/65) and 7.7% (5/65) of them had G3-4 toxicities. Overall, toxicity was the cause of treatment discontinuation in almost a third of cases (28.6%; 34/119), with hypersensitivity reactions as the most prevalent reason for stopping treatment (58.8%; 20/34). Conclusions: In this large real-world series of 2,606 mCRC patients, less than 5% were re-treated with oxaliplatin. A late-disease control was achieved in almost 60% of patients, with a clinically acceptable sustained PFS and safety. Given the low performance of current standard drugs in late care of mCRC, retreatment with oxaliplatin might be considered a viable alternative especially if hopefully biology-based predictive markers for improving patient selection could be found.',\n",

       "  '128Background: A fluoropyrimidine with or without bevacizumab is often used in clinical practice as maintenance therapy after a first-line chemotherapy + bevacizumab induction in mCRC. However, the role of maintenance following an anti-EGFR-based induction and the optimal regimen are not well established. Methods: We searched PubMed and conferences’ proceedings for clinical trials assessing maintenance therapy after first-line treatment for RAS WT mCRC. Two independent reviewers excluded single-arm studies and retrospective reports from trials that were not designed to assess maintenance therapy. We used the method of Guyot et. al. to obtain the individual patient data, followed by a Cox procedure to derive the survival hazard ratios (HR) from studies that did not report that value. Safety analysis included grade 3-4 asthenia, neuropathy, neutropenia, rash, and diarrhea. We performed a random-effects bayesian network metanalysis using the package “GeMTC R Package” to compare all treatment strategies included (anti-EGFR, anti-EGFR + chemotherapy [CT], CT alone, and observation). The risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Results: The systematic review retrieved 145 studies from which 142 were excluded. Two additional studies were found in the Conferences’ Proceedings review. Consequently, 5 studies were included in this NMA. In terms of Progression-Free Survival (PFS), there was a benefit of anti-EGFR and anti-EGFR+CT versus CT alone (HR 0.63 [95%CrI 0.31-1.30] and 0.72 [95%CrI 0.41-1.30], respectively). The rank probability of anti-EGFR being the best option considering PFS was 61%. In terms of Overall Survival (OS), the benefit of anti-EGFR and anti-EGFR+CT versus CT alone was statistically weak (HR 0.92 [95%CrI 0.54-1.50] and 0.84 [95%CrI 0.57-1.20], respectively). The rank probability of anti-EGFR+CT be the best option in terms of OS was 51%. Comparing anti-EGFR versus anti-EGFR+CT resulted in no statistically significant difference. Anti-EGFR-containing regimens increased the rate of rash and diarrhea compared to CT alone (RR 11.23 and 1.23, respectively). The risk of bias was average low, except for the unclear risk of selection bias linked to unpublished studies. Conclusions: Anti-EGFR±CT maintenance therapy improves PFS and OS compared to CT alone or observation in RAS WT mCRC, with manageable safety profile.',\n",

       "  '130Background: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the most common oral drugs in cancer patients. Similarly, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are commonly used to relieve dyspeptic symptoms in patients with cancer. However, gastric pH levels may affect the absorption of TKI through the gastrointestinal system. However, all TKIs do not have the same chemical structure, and the absorption rate of each TKI depends on their solubility in different gastric pH levels. Limited data is available about the clinical outcomes of concomitant use of PPI and regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We present here the results of the multicenter study following the initial results of our single-center experience. Methods: Patients with mCRC treated with regorafenib were included in this multicenter and retrospective study. Patients prescribed PPI after initiation of regorafenib were assigned to the PPI user group, and the remaining patients were assigned to the PPI non-user group. To exclude immortal time bias, the log-rank test was performed between PPI non-user and all patients. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and secondary outcomes were time to treatment failure (TTF) and adverse events (AEs) profile. Results: Two hundred and seventy-two patients from eight cancer centers were included in this study. Most patients were male (59.9%), had liver metastasis (62.1%), and received regorafenib in the third line (52.2%). The median age at the initiation of regorafenib was 60 years (interquartile range (IQR): 51-66)). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 0 or 1 in approximately three out of four patients. The rate of patients with K-RAS mutation was 46.7%. There were 131 (48.2%) and 141 (51.8%) in the PPI user and non-user groups, respectively. The most prescribed PPI was pantoprazole (40.4%). At a median 34.2 months follow-up, the median OS was 6.9 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.3-8.5) and 7.7 months (95% CI:6.6-8.8) in the PPI non-user and all patients, respectively. No statistical significance was observed between the groups (p = 0.913). The median TTF was 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.6-3.9) and 3.4 months (95% CI:2.9-4.0) in the PPI non-user and all patients, respectively. No statistical significance was observed between the groups (p = 0.651). In the time-dependent covariate Cox regression model, there was no difference between PPI user and non-user groups in OS and TTF (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR):0.96, 95% CI:0.74-1.24, p = 0.735 for OS; aHR:0.88, 0.68-1.14, p = 0.354 for TTF). The rates of all AEs were also similar in the PPI user and non-user groups (p = 0.628). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study evaluating the effect of concomitant use of PPI and regorafenib in patients with mCRC, and no adverse survival and safety outcome was observed with the concomitant use of PPI and regorafenib in those patients.',\n",

       "  '131Background: We previously reported the benefit of Contact X-ray Brachytherapy boost (CXB) in achieving a higher clinical complete response (cCR) following partial response to external beam chemoradiotherapy (EBCRT). We now update our report on the organ preservation rate and long-term durability of the cCR in this cohort. Methods: Outcome data for rectal cancer patients referred to our institution from 2003 to 2012 were retrieved from an institutional database after an audit approval. These patients were referred after initial local multidisciplinary team discussion. All patients had EBCRT 45Gy/25/5 weeks with capecitabine 825mg/m2 (Mon-Fri). Those who respond well but has a small residual tumour were offered CXB boost of 90Gy in 3 fractions over 4-6 weeks as they were not suitable or unwilling to undergo completion surgery. Following treatment, patients had close 3 monthly follow-ups with DRE, endoscopy, and MRI in the first 2 years, then 6 monthly up to 5 years. Results: Of 345 consecutive patients with rectal cancer referred to us, 83 patients who responded well to EBCRT but with small suspicious residual disease (≤3 cm) were offered CXB boost. Median age was 72 years (range 36–87) and 58 (69.9%) were males. Initial MRI tumor stages were cT2 (n = 28), cT3 (n = 55) and 54.2% were node positive. The median follow up of surviving patients was 6.4 years (range 2-11 years). cCR was achieved after CXB boost in 53/83 (64%). After achieving cCR, 8/53 (15%) developed local regrowth. However, all patients successfully underwent curative surgery with R(0) resection rate of 24/30 (80%) and only 21/83 (25%) had stoma. Organ preservation was achieved in 62/83 (75%). 12/53 (14%) patients developed metastatic disease. At the end of the study period, 64/83(77%) were cancer free. Conclusions: Our long-term data suggests dose escalation with CXB boost following EBCRT can achieved high organ preservation rate with excellent long-term durable cCR. This approach can provide an alternative treatment option for elderly or comorbid patient patients who are not suitable for surgery. This can also be an option for some patients who wish to avoid surgery upfront after initial diagnosis. Those who needed surgery later for treatment failure can be salvage successfully. A phase 3 European randomised trial OPERA (Organ Preservation in Early Rectal Adenocarcinoma) was set up to evaluate this concept further.',\n",

       "  '132Background: TACH101 is a novel, potent small molecule inhibitor of KDM4, a novel epigenetic target for cancer therapy. KDM4 is a family of histone lysine demethylases that, when overexpressed, drives key processes linked to cancer. Validation of KDM4 as a driver gene was confirmed across gastrointestinal tumor types including esophageal, colon and gastric cancers, and is associated with formation of aggressive tumors. Methods: TACH101 was evaluated in in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo studies including cell inhibition assays, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid models, and bioinformatics analyses studies. Results: In vitro, TACH101 treatment potently inhibited cell proliferation in cell lines and organoid models representing esophageal, CRC, and gastric cancers. TACH101 induced apoptosis in human CRC (HT-29) and esophageal (KYSE-150) cancer cell lines (EC50s 0.033 - 0.092 µM). Further evaluation using a panel of > 300 cell lines from different tumor types showed potent activity of TACH101 against gastric cancer and CRC. In gastric cancer, 2D cell viability inhibition assays conducted on a panel of 11 gastric cancer cell lines showed 9/11 (82%) were sensitive to TACH101 treatment (IC50 0.004 - 0.072 µM); in PDX models, 4/5 (80%) were sensitive to TACH101 treatment (IC50 0.007 - 0.039 µM). In CRC, bioinformatics analysis indicated increased TACH101 sensitivity in cell lines with MSI-H status (IC50 1-150 nM). Sensitivity of MSI-H CRC to TACH101 was further confirmed in a panel of 14 CRC PDX models and 7 CRC organoid models in culture-based viability inhibition assays. In PDX models, 5/5 (100%) characterized as MSI were sensitive to TACH101 treatment (IC50 0.001 - 0.014 µM), whereas 4/8 (50%) characterized as MSS were sensitive to TACH101 (IC50 0.003 - 0.270 µM). In patient derived CRC organoid models, 3/3 (100%) characterized as MSI were sensitive to TACH101 treatment (IC50 0.022 - 0.149 µM) whereas 0/3 (0%) characterized as MSS were sensitive (IC50 > 10 µM). In vivo, TACH101 triggered effective tumor control (≥70%) in xenograft models of CRC (SU60), esophageal (KYSE-150) and gastric (GXA-3036) cancers. Pharmacologic studies showed TACH101 demonstrated favorable cell permeability, good oral bioavailability, and high metabolic stability. Conclusions: Preclinical work on TACH101 KDM4 inhibitor demonstrates compelling data and applicability as a potential therapy for gastrointestinal cancers. Preparations to advance TACH101 into clinical trials are underway.',\n",

Methods: 145 patients (pts) with unresectable, locally advanced rectal cancer. Schemes used: radiotherapy (RT) in 73 (50%) or radiochemotherapy (CRT) in 72 (50%). In RT group conventional fractionation (CFRT) and hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART). In CRT 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions was given with two cycles of 5 Fu-LV chemotherapy in three or five day cycles. Results: Objective response (OR) in RT and CRT group was 60% versus 75%. Resection rate (RR) in RT and CRT: 37% versus 65%. Tumor mobility and laparotomy-based unresectability were significant factors for OR. Performance status, tumor mobility, neoadjuvant treatment method were significant for RR. Five-year LC in CRT versus RT: 68% versus 37%. Five-year OS: 52% versus 27%. CRT was independent positive prognostic factor for resection rate, local control. Tumor volume did not reach significance for any of the end points. Lenght of chemotherapy cycles (three or five days) did not reach significance for any of the endpoints. Toxicity was acceptable in both groups. CRT had best outcome in LC: 68% versus 42% in HART; and 25% in CFRT. Five-year OS was much better in CRT than in CFRT: 52% versus 17%. Conclusions: The results of treatment depend on performance status, patients age, tumor mobility and unresectability based on earlier laparotomy. The lack of influence of the tumor volume on all endpoints indicates the need for radical neoadjuvant treatment independently of tumor volume and underlines the key role of a proper surgical treatment. In patients not suitable for CRT, HART is optimal strategy for its better efficacy than CFRT.',\n",

Based on results of BEACON CRC (NCT02928224), BRAF inhibitor encorafenib + EGFR inhibitor cetuximab was approved for tx of previously treated pts with BRAFV600E mCRC. BREAKWATER (NCT04607421), an ongoing, open-label, global, multicenter, randomized phase 3 study, evaluates 1L EC ± chemotherapy for tx of pts with BRAFV600E mCRC. Here we present preliminary data on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) from the BREAKWATER SLI, which aimed to identify the chemotherapy backbone for EC for the phase 3 portion of BREAKWATER. Methods: SLI inclusion criteria were BRAFV600E mCRC (determined using tumor tissue or blood); evaluable disease (RECIST v1.1); ≤1 prior systemic tx for mCRC; European Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0/1; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Pts previously treated with BRAF/EGFR inhibitors or both oxaliplatin and irinotecan were excluded. Pts received encorafenib 300 mg daily + cetuximab 500 mg/m2 every 2 weeks (Q2W) + either FOLFIRI Q2W or mFOLFOX6 Q2W in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was frequency of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). PK were a secondary endpoint. Data cutoff date: Sep 13, 2021. Results: 57 pts were enrolled (EC + FOLFIRI, n = 30; EC + mFOLFOX6, n = 27). Median (range) age was 57 (28–78) years; 25% were Asian; 65% had ECOG PS 0; 37% had ≥3 organs involved; 58% were treatment naive. At cutoff date, tx was ongoing in 45 (79%) pts. Median (range) duration of tx for encorafenib in EC + FOLFIRI and EC + mFOLFOX6 was 15 (0–31) and 14 (0–27) weeks, respectively. One DLT was observed: grade 4 neutropenia in 1 pt in EC + FOLFIRI. Tx-emergent all-cause serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 20% and 19% and grade ≥3 AEs in 33% and 56% of pts in EC + FOLFIRI and EC + mFOLFOX6, respectively. The table shows frequent (all grade in ≥30% pts or grade ≥3 in ≥10% with either tx) tx-emergent all-cause AEs. One pt died due to disease progression. In EC + FOLFIRI, in the presence of steady-state encorafenib, AUCinf of irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, significantly decreased ̃25% and ̃40%, respectively, compared with values in the absence of encorafenib. In EC + mFOLFOX6, oxaliplatin PK was not significantly altered by steady-state encorafenib. Conclusions: Based on these data, BREAKWATER phase 3 will compare EC ± mFOLFOX6 with mFOLFOX6/FOLFOXIRI/CAPOX ± bevacizumab.

       "  '135Background: Cabo is an anti-VEGFR2/MET/AXL drug with broad multi-kinase inhibitory spectrum. Preclinical and clinical studies in various solid tumors demonstrated favorable immune modulatory activity of Cabo with clinical synergy seen when combined with PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibitors like Durva. Upon completion of phase Ib gastrointestinal (GI) basket CAMILLA trial evaluating Cabo + Durva in 30 patients (pts) demonstrating favorable safety & efficacy, the trial was expanded to phase 2 multi-cohort, multi-center trial of 117 pts. Herein, we report results of the phase 2 CRC cohort, the first evaluation of cabo + IO in this population. Methods: Pts enrolled in this cohort were administered Cabo + Durva at the RP2D of 40mg QD and 1500mg IV Q4W respectively. Enrolled pts must have progressed on 2 or more lines of therapy. Primary outcome measure was investigator assessed overall response rate (ORR) and secondary outcomes were rate of treatment related adverse events (TRAE), investigator assessed disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Subgroup analysis was done in pts with RAS wild type tumors. Exploratory analysis of pathogenic molecular tumor alterations using next generation sequencing (NGS) was done in pts who achieved confirmed partial response (PRc)/ stable disease (SD) > 6 months. Results: Of the 36 pts enrolled, 29 (16F, 13M) were evaluable for efficacy. Median age 57 years (27-76). 90% (26) had ECOG of 1. All had pMMR/MSS, 41% (12) had RAS wild type tumors, and 6.9% (2) had HER2 amplification. 52% (15) had received ≥ 3 lines of therapy. All had metastases at ≥ 3 sites and 79% (23) metastases in the liver. Among 36 pts evaluable for safety, treatment related serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 31% (11/36). Most common TRAEs were grade 1-2 fatigue (53%), nausea (42%), diarrhea (36%), anorexia (31%), hand-foot syndrome (22%), & hypertension (16%). Grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse events (IRAE) occurred in 16.6% (6/36). Efficacy analysis revealed an ORR 27.6% (8/29); PRc 21% (6/29); DCR 86.2% (25/29); median DOR was not reached (NR); median PFS 4.4 months; 6-month PFS 28% & median OS 9.1 months. In the RAS wild type subgroup, ORR (PRc) was 50.0%; DCR 83.3%; median PFS 6.3 months and median OS was NR. Of the 7 pts who achieved PRc/SD > 6 months, one had KRAS G12V tumor mutation along with mutations in ARID1A & IDH1. Remaining pts had RAS wild type tumors & among those, the following NGS alterations were detected: 1 HER-2 amplification, 1 MET amplification, & 2 alterations in ATM. Conclusions: Cabo + Durva demonstrated promising efficacy and was fairly tolerated without new safety signals in heavily treated pMMR/MSS CRC pts. These encouraging results warrant further evaluation of this regimen in a randomized setting as salvage therapy in pMMR/MSS CRC. Clinical trial information: NCT03539822.',\n",

       "  '136Background: O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the principal repair mechanism of DNA damage created by alkylating agents. Approximately 40% of colorectal cancers (CRC) exhibit MGMT promoter hypermethylation, expected to result in gene silencing. The role of MGMT as a biomarker is poorly understood, and quantitative measurement of MGMT protein has not been performed in CRC. We hypothesized that altered tumor MGMT would affect DNA damage response, modulate adaptive anti-tumor immune responses, and influence survival in CRC. Methods: We used multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) to study 4 clinically annotated retrospective patient cohorts treated from 2000 to 2017 at Yale, consisting of 400 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC cases represented in tissue microarray format. These included paired tumors and adjacent non-tumor colonic mucosa (n = 112 pairs in Cohort 1), paired primary CRC and lymph node metastases (n = 31 pairs in Cohort 2), and 2 cohorts with primary stage I-IV tumors (n = 250 in Cohort 3; n = 150 in Cohort 4). We established a QIF panel for simultaneous, localized measurement of DAPI (all cells), cytokeratin (CK; tumor epithelial cells), MGMT, γH2AX (DNA damage response), and CD8. The measurement of fluorescent signals in CK-positive tumor cells or CK-negative stromal cells was achieved using co-localization strategies and the AQUA QIF platform. Results: We identified lower MGMT protein levels in CRC cells than in non-tumor colonic epithelium (p < 0.0001), and in lymph node metastases compared to paired primary CRC tumors (p = 0.0411). Using the visual detection threshold, tumor selective MGMT protein downregulation was identified in 20% of cases in Cohorts 3 and 4. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cases showed decreased tumoral MGMT protein compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) cases (p = 0.002). In Cohorts 3 and 4, low tumoral MGMT was consistently associated with increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (p = 0.0472; p = 0.0002). The association between MGMT and γH2AX was inconsistent. The association between MGMT and CD8 was significant only in MSS cases (p = 0.0001) but not in MSI-H cases (p = 0.0979), supporting that the effect is not driven by MSI-H status. Tumor-selective MGMT downregulation evidenced by a low tumor-to-stroma ratio was associated with improved progression-free survival and overall survival in both Cohorts 3 and 4, but statistical significance was only seen in Cohort 3. Conclusions: MGMT protein downregulation occurs in 20% of CRCs and is associated with increased adaptive anti-tumor immune responses, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and better prognosis. MGMT deficiency may alter DNA repair in tumor cells and mediate the accumulation of antigenic mutations or neopeptides, independent from MMR status. Our results support a biomarker role of MGMT protein and suggest a role for immunotherapy combinations in MGMT deficient tumors.',\n",

       "  \"137Background: Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) is an obligate anaerobe and generally acts as anti-inflammatory manner on the intestinal tract. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), a subtype of B. fragilis, produces Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT) leading to either asymptomatic chronic colonic inflammation or colonic tumor formation. However, the impact of B. fragilis and ETBF on colorectal cancer (CRC) prognoses still remains unclear. We tested whether the presence of B. fragilis and ETBF affect clinical outcome in CRC patients who underwent curative surgery. Methods: We obtained 197 pairs of matched FFPE samples from colorectal cancerous and adjusted non-cancerous tissues of patients with stage II and III CRC who underwent curative resection between 2014 and 2016. Quantitative analyses of B. fragilis and ETBF in the colon tissues were performed using quantitative PCR with primers, 16S rRNA for B. fragilis and bft DNA, respectively. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Among 197 patients, 16S rRNA for B. fragilis DNA and bft DNA were detected in 120 patients (60.9%) and 12 patients (6.1%), respectively. B. fragilis-positive patients had better RFS (5-y RFS rate: 81.4% vs. 73.4%, HR0.59, 95% CI: 0.31-1.12, p =0.10) and OS (5-y OS rate: 88.9% vs 78.3%, HR0.53, 95% CI: 0.26-1.11, p =0.091) compared with B. fragilis-negative patients though statistically not significant. In multivariable analysis for RFS, B. fragilis-positive remained as an independent prognostic factor (HR0.53, 95% CI: 0.28-0.99, p =0.049) along with tumor depth T4 and Stage III, while there was no significance in OS. No significant differences were observed between ETBF and nontoxigenic B. fragilis in patients' characteristics and clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the presence of B. fragilis may predict outcome especially RFS in patients with curatively resected stage II and III CRC. Further research are warranted to explore whether B. fragilis status could be involved in a novel prediction model for outcome in early-stage CRC and develop probiotics treatments to prevent recurrence.\",\n",

       "  '138Background: HIPEC with MMC is a treatment for gastrointestinal cancers metastatic to the peritoneal cavity. The pharmacokinetics of MMC in plasma, peritoneal fluid, and urine are described. The amount of MMC in intraabdominal tissues after HIPEC are not well described. The aim of this study is to evaluate if MMC concentrated in tissue samples after HIPEC by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms. Methods: HIPEC was performed at 40°C with 40mg of MMC for 90 minutes, after which the peritoneal cavity was flushed, anastomoses created as needed, and the wound closed. Eligible patients were treated at a single institution, ≥18 years old, and underwent HIPEC with MMC. Samples were taken of the omentum, peritoneum, liver core biopsy, tumor, and mesenteric fat before and after HIPEC. All patients signed informed consent. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, minced, and sonicated in 500µL of phosphate buffered saline. The homogenized samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC for MMC. The HPLC was performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000. Analysis was performed with a Kinetex - 5µm Biphenyl 100A \\x96 150 x 4.6mm column. MMC was detected with a Diode Array Detector 3000 with fixed UV at 365nm, 280nm, 254nm, and 210nm. The mobile phase used isocratic 40% acetonitrile and 60% water at 0.5 ml/min. The analysis volume was 10µL. Samples were blinded prior to analysis and analyzed in triplicate. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled, 11 were female, the average age was 57 years (range: 30 \\x96 85). Diagnoses were low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (7), high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (1), appendiceal adenocarcinoma (1), colon adenocarcinoma (1), colon mucinous adenocarcinoma (1), peritoneal mesothelioma (1), and small bowel mucinous adenocarcinoma (1). Complete tissue samples were available for 10 patients. Two patients had complete cytoreduction and did not have tumor for analysis after HIPEC. One patient refused liver biopsy. MMC was not detected in any sample prior to HIPEC. After HIPEC, MMC was most often detected in peritoneum (12 of 13 cases) and tumor (9 of 11). MMC was less often detected in omentum (5 of 13), mesenteric fat (2 of 13), or liver (1 of 12). Conclusions: MMC concentrated in 92% of peritoneal samples, 82% of tumor samples, and less often in liver tissue. MMC is hydrophilic which may contribute to the low detection rates in omentum and mesenteric fat. A reliable method to measure MMC concentration in normal and malignant tissues is novel and may have clinical implications. Our next steps are to expand the cohort of patients and evaluate whether tissue concentration is associated with clinical outcomes.',\n",

       "  \"139Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer and has a poor prognosis and high recurrence rate. Research has shown that the lipid microenvironment surrounding tumors is closely associated with the occurrence, development, and metastasis of CRC. Recently, advances in artificial intelligence have greatly improved the accuracy of models for CRC prognosis and survival analysis. Methods: According to pathological images from the National Center for Tumor diseases(NCT), the University Medical Center Mannheim(UMM) database and the ImageNet data set, a model called VGG19 was pre-trained. A deep convolutional neural network(CNN), VGG19CRC, was trained by the migration learning method. According to the VGG19CRC model, adipose tissue scores were calculated for TCGA-CRC hematoxylin and eosin(H&E) images and images from patients at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University and First People’s Hospital of Chenzhou. Kaplan-Meier(KM) analysis was used to compare the overall survival(OS) of patients. The XCell and MCP-Counter algorithms were used to evaluate the immune cell scores of the patients. Gene set enrichment analysis(GSEA) and single-sample GSEA(ssGSEA) were used to analyze upregulated and downregulated pathways. Results: In TCGA-CRC, patients with high-adipocytes(high-ADI) CRC had significantly shorter OS times than those with low-ADI CRC. In a validation queue from Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University(Local-CRC1), patients with high-ADI had worse OS than CRC patients with low-ADI. In another validation queue from First People's Hospital of Chenzhou(Local-CRC2), patients with low-ADI CRC had significantly longer OS than patients with high-ADI CRC. In subgroup analysis, ADI could be used as a prognostic marker for patients with colon adenocarcinoma(COAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma(READ), as well as male and female CRC patients. Among these subgroups, patients with lower ADI also had significantly improved OS. Compared with the low-ADI group, high-ADI patients had significantly decreased CD8+ T cells, T cells,and monocytes in the tumor immune microenvironment(TIME), while M2 macrophages were significantly increased. According to the GSEA and ssGSEA analyses, pathways mediating anti-tumor immunity were significantly downregulated in the high-ADI group, while some oncogenic signaling pathways were significantly upregulated. Conclusions: We developed a deep convolution network to segment various tissues from pathological H&E images of CRC and automatically quantify ADI. This allowed us to further analyze and predict the survival of CRC patients according to information from their segmented pathological tissue images, such as tissue components and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that ADI may also predict OS in CRC patients and among the subgroups.\",\n",

       "  '140Background: NRG Oncology/NSABP C-08 tested the efficacy of adding bev to mFOLFOX in patients (pts) with stage II or III colon cancer. In an unplanned analysis we showed that MMR status was predictive of bev benefit with dMMR pts receiving statistically significant bev benefit. More recently, we showed that immune cells and immune checkpoint proteins have differential effects on prognosis and bev benefit in C-08 (ASC0 2021). As part of a preplanned secondary objective of an NCTN-CCSC approved protocol, we tested the association of VEGFR, VEGFA, and CD31, with clinical outcomes and treatment benefit in dMMR and pMMR pts enrolled in C-08. To determine what subset of pts within C-08 received bev benefit, we tested the 10-gene IFNɣ signature (Ayers et\\xa0al 2017), which has been shown to associate with response to ICB in other studies. Methods: VEGFR, VEGFA, and CD31 were quantitated in tumors from C-08 pts (N=1,485) using m-IF and the Vectra Pathology System and inForm software. Gene expression data of C-08 (n=387) via DASLR microarrays was used to test the IFNɣ signature for association with bev benefit in dMMR and pMMR pts. All markers were tested for associations with prognosis and bev benefit in dMMR and pMMR pts using recurrence-free interval, median cut points, and Cox models. Results: VEGFR, VEGFA, and CD31 were not prognostic in the total C-08 cohort nor in dMMR or pMMR subsets. However, high VEGFR was associated with bev benefit in dMMR pts p=0.0012, HR=0.08 [95% CI; 0.025-0.224], n=117) but not in pts with pMMR (n=555) (int p=0.03). Pts whose tumors showed higher expression of the IFNɣ signature had a better prognosis than did pts with a low signature. Importantly, in the entire C-08 cohort with available DASL data, pts with low IFNɣ signatures received bev benefit (p=0.034, HR=0.59 [95% CI: 0.36-0.97], n=211). When low IFNɣ tumors were further split by MMR status both dMMR and pMMR pts showed a trend to receive bev benefit, however, numbers of pts were too small to make firm conclusions (dMMR no bev vs. bev p=0.02, n=11; pMMR no bev vs. bev, p=0.051, n=167). Conclusions: High VEGFR is associated with bev benefit in dMMR pts. In agreement with other studies, we observe that the IFNɣ signature is associated with a good prognosis in C-08, however, unique to this study is the observation that IFNɣ low is associated with bev benefit in the entire C-08 cohort. The association of high IFNɣ signature with ICB response seen in several other studies, plus our observation that low IFNɣ is associated with bev benefit in C-08, suggests that bev and ICB are most efficacious on different subsets of pts. Current clinical trial, GI-004, is testing the efficacy of the bev + atezolizumab combination. Examination of these markers may be informative.

       "  '141Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and survival can be improved if early, suspect imaging features on CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) can be routinely identified. At present, up to 40% of these features are undiagnosed on routine CTAP, but this can be improved with a second observer. In this study, we developed a deep ensemble learning method for detecting CRC on CTAP to determine if increasing agreement between ensemble models can decrease the false positives detected by artificial intelligence (AI) second-observer. Methods: 2D U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) containing 31 million trainable parameters was trained with 58 CRC CT images from Banner MD Anderson (AZ) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (TX) (51 used for training and 7 for validation) and 59 normal CT scans from Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center. 20 of the 25 CRC cases from public domain data (The Cancer Genome Atlas) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The CRC was segmented using ITK-SNAP open-source software (v. 3.8). To apply the deep ensemble approach, five CNN models were trained independently with random initialization using the same U-Net architect and the same training data. Given a testing CT scan, each of the five trained CNN models was applied to produce tumor segmentation for the testing CT scan. The tumor segmentation results produced by the trained CNN models were then fused using a simple majority voting rule to produce consensus tumor segmentation results. The segmentation was analyzed by the percentage of correct detection, the number of false positives per case, and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). If parts of the CRC were flagged by AI, then it was considered correct. A detection was considered false positive if the marked lesion did not overlap with any CRC; contiguous false positives across different slices of CT image were considered a single false positive. DSC measures the quality of the segmentation by measuring the overlap between the ground-truth and AI detected lesion. Results: Our results showed that increasing the agreement between the 5 models dramatically decreases the number of false positives per CT at the expense of slight decrease in accuracy and DSC. This is described in the table. Conclusions: Our results show that AI-based second observer can potentially detect CRC on routine CTAP. Although the initial result yields high false positives per case, ensemble voting is an effective method for decreasing the false positives with a slight decrease in accuracy. This technique can be further improved for eventual clinical application.Pilot results of AI-second observer for CRC detection.Voter AgreementAccuracyFalse PositivesDSC Histogram PeakOne-Voter80%220.25-0.5Two-Voter60%7.6< 0.25Three-Voter30%3.70',\n",

       "  '142Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and its outcome can be improved with better detection of incidental early CRC on routine CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP). AI-second observer (AI) has the potential as shown in our companion abstract. The bottleneck in training AI is the time required for radiologists to segment the CRC. We compared two techniques for accelerating the segmentation process: 1) Sparse annotation (annotating some of the CT slice containing CRC instead of every slice); 2) Allowing AI to perform initial segmentation followed by human adjustment. Methods: 2D U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) containing 31 million trainable parameters was trained with 58 CRC CT images from Banner MD Anderson (AZ) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (TX) (51 used for training and 7 for validation) and 59 normal CT scans from Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center. Twenty of the 25 CRC cases from public domain data (The Cancer Genome Atlas) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The CRC was segmented using ITK-SNAP open-source software (v. 3.8). For the first objective, 3 separate models were trained (fully annotated CRC, every other slice, and every third slice). The AI-annotation on the TCGA dataset was analyzed by the percentage of correct detection of CRC, the number of false positives, and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). If parts of the CRC were flagged by AI, then it was considered correct. A detection was considered false positive if the marked lesion did not overlap with CRC; contiguous false positives across different slices of CT image were considered a single false positive. DSC measures the quality of the segmentation by measuring the overlap between the ground-truth and AI detected lesion. For the second objective, the time required to adjust the AI-produced annotation was compared to the time required for annotating the entire CRC without AI assistance. The AI-models were trained using ensemble learning (see our companion abstract for details of the techniques). Results: Our results showed that skipping slices of tumor in training did not alter the accuracy, false positives, or DSC classification of the model. When adjusting the AI-observer segmentation, there was a trend toward decreasing the time required to adjust the annotation compared to full manual segmentation, but the difference was not statistically significant (Table; p=0.121). Conclusions: Our results show that both skipping slices of tumor as well as starting with AI-produced annotation can potentially decrease the effort required to produce high-quality ground truth without compromising the performance of AI. These techniques can help improve the throughput to obtain a large volume of cases to train AI for detecting CRC.Annotation TechniqueMedian Time (min:sec)Manual13:45Ensemble 18:02Ensemble 27:41',\n",

We hypothesized that functional genetic variants in genes involved in the antioxidant system may be associated with the efficacy of cetuximab in mCRC patients. Methods: We analyzed genomic and clinical data from FIRE-3, a phase III trial which compared cetuximab and bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI in untreated mCRC patients. Genomic DNA extracted from blood samples was genotyped using an OncoArray (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Candidate 13 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (TXN rs2301242, TXN rs2301241, TXN2 rs4821494, TXN2 rs9619611, TXN2 rs59841625, CAT rs7943316, CAT rs564250, CAT rs11604331, CAT rs1001179, CAT rs769217, GPX4 rs757229, GPX4 rs4807542, and GPX4 rs713041) were tested for association with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS), using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. To confirm the predictive value, the treatment-by-SNP interaction was tested. Results: A total of 236 patients were available for the SNP analyses (cetuximab arm, n = 129; bevacizumab arm, n = 107). In the cetuximab arm, two SNPs were significantly associated with clinical outcomes in univariate analyses: TXN2 rs4821494 (T/T vs any G allele, hazard ratio [HR] on OS = 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–4.56, log-rank p = 0.04) and GPX4 rs4807542 (G/G vs any A allele, HR on OS = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.05–3.98, log-rank p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis confirmed the significance in TXN2 rs4821494 (T/T vs any G allele, HR on OS = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.06–5.72, p = 0.03). In the bevacizumab arm, univariate analyses did not detect any significant associations between the SNPs and clinical outcomes. Treatment-by-SNP interaction test showed the significant predictive value of TXN2 rs4821494 in terms of OS (p = 0.03). Conclusions: TXN2 rs4821494 involved in the antioxidant system may predict the efficacy of cetuximab, in comparing with bevacizumab, in the first-line treatment of mCRC. Our novel findings warrant further validation studies.',\n",

       "  \"144Background: The incidence of young onset colorectal cancer (yoCRC) is rising at alarming rates. The gut microbiome may be a factor accounting for the increase. We analyzed differences in the intratumoral microbiome of yoCRC vs average onset CRC (aoCRC) and its clinical impact. Methods: We identified 314 histologically confirmed cases of stage I-IV CRC that underwent surgical resection at our institution from 2000-2020, diagnosed <50 years of age for yoCRC and >60 years for aoCRC, who consented to a prospective biorepository. 36 cases were excluded due to nonmalignant, non-adenocarcinoma or metastatic site specimens. Fresh frozen tissue from the primary tumor with paired adjacent nonmalignant tissue specimens were analyzed. 16S rDNA was isolated and sequence reads were assigned to genus level amplicon sequence variants in DADA2 and analyzed for alpha and beta diversity using Phyloseq. Statistical tests included analysis of variance (ANOVA), permutational multivariate analysis (PERMANOVA), linear regression, and Wilcoxon test. Differential abundance and correlation analysis were adjusted for sex and ethnicity as confounding factors. Correlation analysis was adjusted with Benjamini Hochberg correction. Clinical differences were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Results: Of the cohort of 278 patients, 137 had yoCRC (median age 43 years, range 16-49) and 141 had aoCRC (median age 73 years, range 61-95). yoCRC patients were more likely to have stage III or IV disease at presentation (29% vs 14%, p =0.002; 29% vs 18%, p =0.024 respectively), left sided tumors (74% vs 58%, p =0.003) and receive neoadjuvant therapy (29% vs 15%, p =0.004). yoCRC had significantly higher tumor microbial alpha diversity than aoCRC (p <2.22e−16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Beta diversity analysis demonstrated significantly different diversity of genera between the groups (R2=0.12, p =0.001, PERMANOVA). The prevalent taxa identified in both groups were Lactobacillus, Bacillus and Listeria. Differential abundance analysis (ANOVA, p <0.05) revealed a significant variation of intratumoral microbiome (Table). Correlation analysis revealed an association of longer overall survival (OS) with the presence of Akkermansia in yoCRC (R2 =0.36, p <0.001), but not in aoCRC. Conclusions: We found significant differences between the intratumoral microbiome of yoCRC and aoCRC. In particular, Akkermansia, considered a healthy gut microbe, was found in greater relative abundance in yoCRC and correlated with improved OS. Further studies are warranted to understand the nature of association of these microbes with the development of and outcomes in yoCRC.

       "  '145Background: Based on promising results from latest trials, a crucial point is to evaluate whether encorafenib (E) plus cetuximab (C), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, can improve clinical outcomes relative to current standard of care in previously untreated BRAFV600E mutant mCRC. Considering the high number of BRAFV600E mutant mCRC patients who will never receive a second-line treatment, the rationale of this strategy is to maximize treatment outcome within the first-line setting. Methods: We performed an in\\xa0vivo study using human BRAFV600E CRC cell line-derived xenografts in nude mice. We evaluated the efficacy of encorafenib (E) + cetuximab (C), FOLFOX, and FOLFIRI, both as individual regimens and in combinations. Mice were treated for 3 weeks and followed for an additional 8 weeks to evaluate durability of tumor control. Additionally, we validated our findings using 3 BRAFV600E mutated patient derived xenografts. Tumors progressing on single agent and combined treatment were profiled by RNA sequencing, protein extraction for RPPA/Western blot, and establishment of in\\xa0vitro primary cell cultures for further analyses. Results: Our study showed across all 4 models both FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, each in combination with encorafenib plus cetuximab, having greater efficacy than encorafenib plus cetuximab or either chemotherapy alone. No significant change in toxicity was seen with the addition of chemotherapy. Interestingly, in the one model with long term treatment, FOLFOX + E +/- C performed greatest over the long-term, with significant endpoint separation against all other treatment arms (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Taken together, results from our study suggest that the addition of chemotherapy to BRAF+EGFR targeted therapy can further increase the magnitude of response in BRAFV600E mCRC and is a promising combination now being explored clinically. Additionally, this research will substantially contribute to our understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of resistance to target therapies and chemo-based approach in BRAFV600Econtext.',\n",

       "  '146Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Though immune checkpoint inhibition has proven effective for a number of other tumors, it offers benefits in only a small group of CRC. In general, heterogenous cell groups in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the major barrier for unveiling the causes of low immune response. Therefore, deconvolution of cellular components in highly heterogeneous microenvironments is crucial for understanding those mechanisms. Single cell sequencing technology revolutionized TME research enabling profiling cells in high resolution. Methods: We have analyzed scRNA-seq data from 23 CRC patients with pre-treatment primary tumors using Seurat V3 pipeline. To investigate intercellular ligand-receptor interactions, we used CellPhoneDB and CellChat methods. The results of two independent analyses showed 4 CRC samples with no SPP1-CD44 interaction. It is known, that OPN which is the protein encoded by SPP1 gene, binds to CD44 and can cause cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, analysis of the cellular composition of all 23 samples did not reveal differences in SPP1+ macrophages’ content for those 4 “no SPP1-CD44” samples. To investigate the mechanisms that could cause differences in SPP1-CD44 expression across the samples, we analyzed developmental trajectories of single cells using Slingshot trajectory inference method. Results: Ligand-receptor interactions analysis revealed 4 CRC samples that lacked SPP1-CD44 interaction that is known to be responsible for tumor progression in CRC. But the proportion of SPP1+ cells was not significantly different in those 4 samples compared to other samples. Trajectory inference analysis showed that the cells from “no SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage markers in the end of the trajectory. While cells from “high SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage markers at the same point. Conclusions: Based on our data-driven study, we suggest that SPP1+ macrophages’ heterogeneity may affect SPP1-CD44 interaction. Thus, targeting SPP1+ macrophages that have anti-inflammatory phenotype can potentially interrupt SPP1-CD44 interaction and therefore reduce tumor progression and immune suppression.',\n",

       "  '147Background: Over half of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) develop liver metastases. While immunotherapy is an emerging treatment of solid tumors, its use among CRC patients is limited. Furthermore, gene expression patterns of liver-specific CRC metastases remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify a high-risk gene expression profile for patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) to better inform prognosis and development of novel targeted therapies. Methods: Fifty-three FFPE CRLM samples from patients who underwent complete metastatectomy from 2009-2017 were examined. Expression profiling of extracted RNA was performed using NanoString Immuno-Oncology (IO360) 750-gene panel. Statistical analyses using cutoffs of absolute log 2-fold change≥1.5 and p-value≤0.05 were performed. Patients were analyzed by extremes of outcomes: survival time in the lowest quartile compared to those still alive at last follow-up. Results: Eight differentially expressed genes were associated with poor survival. Overexpressed genes included IL6R, CXCL2, C7, MGMT, PCK2, CSF1 and LILRB4 (Table). PLA2G2A was under-expressed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates differential gene expression associated with poor survival among patients with CRLM. Specific genes of interest include IL6R, MGMT, CSF1 and LILRB4. IL6R is a known effector in tumor proliferation via IL-6 signaling from tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T-cells. MGMT repairs alkylating DNA damage and is implicated in carcinogenesis and response to chemotherapy. CSF1 promotes macrophage differentiation to M2 phenotype, suppressing inflammation and anti-tumor defense mechanisms. LILRB4 activation via MDSCs leads to T-cell inhibition. These overall suggest a myeloid-dominant tumor immune microenvironment and represent important potential therapeutic targets. Next steps include performing immunohistochemistry to validate findings at the protein level and investigate the tumor intrinsic role using human cell lines.Overexpressed genes associated with poor survival (25th Percentile).GeneLog 2-Fold Changep-valueFunctionIL6R2.260.034Promotes cellular proliferationCXCL21.890.009Promotes angiogenesis, cancer metastasisC71.760.045Component of membrane attack complex for cell deathMGMT1.730.034Repair of alkylating DNA damagePCK21.620.034Gluconeogenesis, anabolic metabolism, cellular proliferationCSF11.60.028Regulates macrophage differentiation to M2 phenotypeLILRB41.580.032Activates myeloid-derived suppressor cells to inhibit T-cell activation & proliferationIL6R: Interleukin-6 receptor; CXCL2: Chemokine ligand 2; C7: Complement Component 7; MGMT: O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase; PCK2: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2; CSF1: Colony Stimulating Factor 1; LILRB4: Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor Subfamily B-4.',\n",

       "  '148Background: Right-sided colon cancer is associated with worse outcomes than left-sided disease, likely due to an association between tumour/host factors and tumour sidedness. The present study analyses the association between tumour sidedness, clinicopathological features and common mutations to better understand this discrepancy in outcomes. Methods: The association between tumour sidedness, clinicopathological characteristics and survival was examined within a cohort of patients undergoing curative surgery for TNM I-III colon cancer. Results: 3,419 patients were identified. 54% of cases were right-sided and associated with worse 3-year OS/CSS. On multivariate analysis for clinical factors: sex (OR 0.63), Systemic Inflammatory Grade (SIG), anaemia and differentiation (OR 0.80/0.31/0.57) were associated with T3 cancer sidedness and: sex, anaemia and differentiation (OR 0.61/0.46/0.57) were associated with T4 cancer sidedness. On further MVA including mutational factors anaemia/BRAF status remained significant in T3/T4 cancer respectively (OR 0.08/0.09). BRAF mutant status was associated with SIG in all patients/T3 disease (p=0.046/0.016). Conclusions: Worse outcomes seen in right-sided colon cancer are likely explained predominantly by factors including tumour stage, SIG, anaemia and BRAF mutational status. BRAF mutations are associated with the Systemic Inflammatory Response and further research is required to better understand this relationship taking into the tumour microenvironment, microsatellite instability.a.

       "  '149Background: Patient-derived organoids (PDO) have been shown to have a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. PDO have also been used to perform high throughput drug screens and shown to correlate with patient response to therapy. Unfortunately, PDO require too much tissue, take too long to establish and are too inefficient and costly for adoption into the clinic. The ideal assay for clinical use would be one that could be performed in less than14 days from a core biopsy to minimize delay in therapy. We have now circumvented these barriers by leveraging recent technological advances in emulsion microfluidics and droplet generators to develop MicroOrganoSpheres (MOS) that can be established and used to predict drug sensitivity within 14 days of obtaining a biopsy. Methods: 18-gauge core biopsy specimens from patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis who subsequently received an oxaliplatin based therapy were first obtained. Biopsy specimens were minced, enzymatically digested and mixed with components necessary to generate MOS. The mixture was then processed through a custom fabricated flow-focusing droplet microfluidic chip in our MOS Generator Device to generate MOS. After culturing for 8-10 days, MOS were then used to perform drug screen with oxaliplatin. Results: A total of twelve CRC biopsies from liver metastasis were obtained and processed to generate MOS with a success rate of 12/12 (100%). Furthermore, drug screens with oxaliplatin were performed on all twelve samples with an average time to drug screen of 10.1 days. We next wanted to determine if there was a correlation between MOS drug sensitivity and patient clinical outcome (ie. time on treatment). For the first eight patients, MOS was used to predict sensitivity to oxaliplatin and using a drug sensitivity cut-off of 1 uM, four patients were predicted to be sensitive to oxaliplatin and four patients were predicted to be resistant. Three of the four patients predicted to be sensitive to oxaliplatin continue to be on treatment (> 6 months), whereas 3 of the four patients predicted to be resistant to oxaliplatin progressed on oxaliplatin based therapy within 8 weeks (sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 100%, positive predictive value = 100%, negative predictive value = 75%). Conclusions: MOS can be generated from core biopsies and correlates to time on treatment. Although further studies will need to be conducted, the ability to generate MOS and perform a drug screen in < 14 days will allow for the development of a precision oncology platform that can be rapidly used in the clinic to guide therapy.',\n",

However, the effects of combination of fruquintinib and PD-1 blockade on MSS-CRC and its relative mechanisms are not well determined. Methods: Syngeneic xenograft mouse models were establish using murine MC38 and CT26 colon cancer cells to assess treatment efficacy. The percentages of immune cells were detected in peripheral blood, spleen and tumor tissues in tumor-bearing mice by flow cytometry analysis. Angiogenesis in tumor tissues was detected by immunofluorescence. The safety of drug treatment was evaluated by histopathology analysis in murine main organs. The efficacy of combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab were verified in the treatment of MSS-CRC patients. Results: Our results showed the combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab exhibited strongest inhibition of tumor growth and achieved longest survival time in mice bearing MC38 or CT26 xenograft tumors, compared to fruquintinib and sintilimab alone. Mechanistically, the combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab reduced angiogenesis, reprogramed the vascular structure, enhanced the infiltration of CD8+T cells, CD8+TNFα+T cells and CD8+IFNγ+T cells and reduced the ratios of MDSCs and macrophages in mice. No obvious damage was observed in main organs in tumor-bearing mice with the combined treatment. Moreover, the treatment of combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab anti-PD-1 antibodies achieved effective response in five refractory advanced MSS CRC patients. Conclusions: Our results show that combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab synergistically inhibits CRC growth by alterating antitumor immune microenvironment.',\n",

       "  '151Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer worldwide with relatively poor patient survival. Transcriptome assay could be used to personalize CRC treatment thus complementing standard mutation analysis. Methods: We performed retrospective hybrid experimental and meta-analysis of CRC patient gene expression data with available progression-free survival (PFS) information and/or targeted drug response status. In total we analyzed 243 gene expression profiles from four publicly available (TCGA and three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus GSE19860, GSE19862, GSE104645), and one experimental (PRJNA663280) patient cohorts. Each gene expression profile was analyzed using bioinformatic second-opinion platform Oncobox to calculate balanced drug efficiency scores (BES) to build personalized ratings of potentially effective targeted drugs. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) metric and Cox regression analysis were used to assess Oncobox capacity to predict tumor response and PFS, respectively. Results: Patients from GSE19860 (n = 12), GSE19862 (n = 14), GSE104645 (n = 81) received bevacizumab as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy as the nearest line of treatment after biopsy collection. Oncobox correctly classified treatment responders vs non-responders with AUC 0.94, 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. BES value was strongly associated with PFS (HR = 0.53, CI 0.33-0.84, log-rank test p-value 0.0057) in the GSE104645 cohort. However, BES was ineffective for predicting response and PFS after second-line (after biopsy collection) treatment with cetuximab. BES also predicted treatment response with AUC 0.74 in the TCGA cohort (n = 17) treated with 4 different targeted drugs. Thirty clinical outcomes were collected for 14 patients from our experimental cohort PRJNA663280. Patients were treated with 10 different targeted drugs. BES was an effective biomarker that could predict treatment outcomes with AUC 0.74 for all lines of therapy and 0.94 for the first line therapy (after biopsy), and could predict PFS after first-line treatment (HR 0.14, CI 0.027-0.73, log-rank test p-value 0.0091). Conclusions: Our results suggest that RNA profiling in tumor samples may be helpful for personalizing prescriptions of targeted therapeutics in CRC. Using recent biopsies is essential to obtain robust estimates of targeted drugs efficacy.',\n",

       "  '152Background: Although BRAF V600E accounts for the majority of the BRAF mutations in mCRC, non-V600 BRAF variants have been shown in recent years to represent a distinct molecular subtype of mCRC. This study provides a comprehensive profile of BRAF V600 and non-V600 variants, their clonalities and co-mutations in mCRC using a large genomic database of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Methods: A systematic analysis of Guardant360 results was performed among ctDNA samples of mCRC patients from September 2014 to May 2021. A variant was defined as clonal if the mutant allele frequency (MAF) was greater than 50% of the highest somatic MAF in the sample; otherwise it was defined as subclonal. A previously validated anti-EGFR exposure score was applied to predict prior anti-EGFR therapies. Co-mutation analysis was conducted with BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, NF1, ERBB2, PIK3CA and SMAD4. Results: 1,733 out of 14,742 mCRC patients had at least one BRAF variant, including 6.5% of patients with BRAF V600 variants, 1.1% with class II variants, 1.9% with class III variants, and 3.2% with unclassified variants. 431 unique BRAF variants were identified in a total of 1,905 BRAF variants. 70.7% of BRAF V600 variants were clonal while most (56.0%-78.8%) class II, III and unclassified BRAF variants were subclonal (Table). Patients with non-BRAF V600 variants tend to be younger and male. The prevalence of BRAF class II and III variants were higher (2.1% and 3.7%) in patients with predicted prior anti-EGFR exposure compared with patients predicted to have no prior exposure (0.8% and 1.4%). BRAF variants of all classes are more likely to be subclonal in patients predicted to have anti-EGFR exposure than those predicted nonexposed (p <0.05 in all classes, Fisher’s exact test). Among patients with non-BRAF V600 variants, a greater fraction of co-occurring KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected in those predicted to have prior anti-EGFR exposure. In the patients without predicted EGFR exposure, BRAF class II and III variants showed a higher rate of co-occurring KRAS mutations (25.6% and 21.5%) and co-occurring NRAS mutations (5.8% and 2.7%) compared with BRAF V600 variants (2.4% for KRAS and 0.1% for NRAS); however, co-occurring KRAS G12C was only noted in one patient with a BRAF class II variant. The analysis of outcome data by variant class will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: We noted significant differences between BRAF V600 and class II/III variants using a large genomic database. Within BRAF class II and III variants, the enrichment in patients with predicted anti-EGFR exposure and the high fraction of co-mutations in KRAS/NRAS suggest a unique therapeutic need for these patients.% of total BRAF variants (% of the class)clonalsubclonalV60034.3% (70.7%)14.2% (29.3%)Class 23.2% (37.4%)5.4% (62.6%)Class 36.6% (44.0%)8.3% (56.0%)Unclassified5.9% (21.2%)22% (78.8%)',\n",

       "  '153Background: Treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains heterogenous. Clinicians are guided by pre-treatment clinical assessment alone in determining neoadjuvant strategy. More must be done to uncover biological mechanisms underpinning response and resistance. We have developed a biospecimen collection protocol in LARC performing serial sampling of tumors and peripheral blood samples prior to, during and after treatment to characterize the biological evolution of this heterogenous response. Here we present early proof of concept results with a focus on the intra-tumoral immune response relating to radiotherapy (RT). Methods: Patients receiving standard-of-care neoadjuvant RT were recruited to an ethically approved study between Dec 2018 - Aug 2021. The protocol consisted of a baseline biopsy and blood sample prior to RT followed by repeat sampling at 2, 6 and 12wks after Day 1 of RT. Standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for markers of immune activity. Target capture sequencing was performed using RNA baits extracted from serial biopsies to target a 276 genes panel. Paired tumor-normal sequencing was performed. Bulk 3’ RNA seq (Lexogen Illumina Quantseq) characterized immune and inflammatory gene expression. A multiplex bead array (Luminex xPONENT) of 24 cytokines and chemokines was performed using serial plasma samples. Results: 17pts were recruited, 3 with stage IV disease. 14pts received chemoradiation and 3 pts had short-course based regimens. Treatment responses were evaluable in 14pts: graded complete in 2pts; good/ near complete in 7pts and partial/ poor in 5pts. All tumors were MSS, and most frequently mutated genes were APC (75%), KRAS (38%), NRAS (25%), NOTCH1 (25%) and PIK3CA (25%) (n = 8). Quantseq demonstrated that the immune/ inflammatory response, as measured by interferon-gamma response and IL-6/ JAK-STAT signaling, was significantly elevated up to 12wks after Day 1 RT, with a peak at around 6wks (n = 3). Correlative IHC showed an increase in innate immune cells in pts with a favorable response at 6wks (n = 8). Cytokine/ chemokine analysis suggested patients with a favorable response demonstrated strong inflammatory (MCP1 & IL-17a) responses 2 and 6wks post-RT and strong CTL (Granzyme B) and Th1 (GM-CSF & IP-10) responses 12wks post-RT (n = 10). Conclusions: We show acquisition of meaningful genomic and transcriptomic material from serial biopsies in rectal cancer is possible. Early data suggest that dynamic profiling of rectal tumors demonstrates transcriptomic evolution during treatment. Specifically, we show that the immune response to radiotherapy peaks at around 6wks after initiation of RT and persists to 12wks. This supports ongoing trials of immunomodulatory treatments in combination with, and following, RT in rectal cancer. Further work is required to define differences between responders and non-responders.',\n",

       "  '154Background: Our prior work has shown that PI3K-altered colorectal cancer (CRC), with PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss, has increased expression of key immune checkpoints (including PD-L1) resulting in immune evasion, despite increased immune engagement. Here, we investigated the impact of PI3K-AKT inhibition on the immune repertoire of CRC. Methods: Multiplex immunofluorescence was performed using two Vectra panels [1: AE1/AE3, CD3, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, CD68; and 2: AE1/AE3, CD3, CD8, Granzyme B (GzB), CD45RO, FoxP3] on paired biopsies (baseline and cycle 1 day 15) from 6 patients with PI3K-altered metastatic CRC (mCRC) treated with AKT inhibitor, MK2206 (200 mg oral weekly), on a phase 2 clinical trial. Separately, one million CT26 CRC cells were implanted in BALB/C-e mice. After 48 hours, 10 mice/group were randomized for treatment with pan-PI3K inhibitor copanlisib (C, 10 mg/Kg IV 2x/week), anti-PD-1 (P, 200 µg IP 2x/week), copanlisib + anti-PD-1 (C+P), or control (Ct), for 21 days. Mouse tumors were stained with 6-plex immunohistochemistry (CD3, CD8, PD-L1, Ki67, GzB, AE1/AE3). Data were analyzed using related-samples Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Student’s t-test, as appropriate. Results: In PI3K-altered mCRC patients, AKT inhibition resulted in a trend towards increased median densities of intratumoral CD8+ T cells (0.8 vs 4.8 density/mm2, P = 0.14) and memory T cells (0 vs 10.3, P = 0.07), and decreased density of macrophages (12.4 vs 0, P = 0.07). No antigen experienced T cells were seen and activated CD8+ T cells were present in 1 patient only. In CT26 mice, PI3K and PD-1 co-inhibition resulted in the smallest mean tumor volumes (C+P 12% of Ct vs C 40% and P 42% of Ct, P < 0.05 for both), and the highest median % of intratumoral CD8+Ki67+ T cells as compared to all other treatment arms (C+P 1.6% vs C 0.5%, P 0.4%, Ct 0.6%, P < 0.05 for each pairwise comparison). C+P also increased the % of total CD3+ and CD8+ cells as compared to Ct and C (P < 0.05 for all). C alone did not increase immune infiltration in this non-PI3K activated model. Conclusions: PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition has the potential to improve effector T cell infiltration in PI3K-altered CRC. PI3K inhibitor synergizes with anti-PD-1 to improve treatment efficacy and CD8+ T cell proliferation. The mechanisms behind this immune repertoire shift are yet to be elucidated, such as via cytokine modulation. Therapeutic approaches to activate the proliferating CD8+ cells would be useful, and may require PI3Kα/β specific inhibitors to allow early T cell activation through PI3Kδ/γ isoforms.',\n",

       "  '155Background: Understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in the response to chemotherapy and radiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC, stage II-III) can lead to the identification of novel immunologic biomarkers to preselect patients who can avoid surgery and benefit from watch-and-wait strategies. Methods: We performed DNA and RNA sequencing of pre-treatment biopsies from 89 LARC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, including 5 microsatellite unstable (MSI) and 84 microsatellite stable (MSS) patients. We computed single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores for immune infiltrates and signaling pathways implicated in tumor progression. Immunofluorescence and hematoxylin-eosin staining of tumor slides was performed to confirm significant correlations with RNA-Seq estimates of immune markers. Other genomic variables were also included in the analysis, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), fraction of genome altered by copy number changes, whole genome duplication events and somatic mutations in rectal cancer driver genes and pathways. Results were largely replicated using an independent cohort of 42 LARC samples with publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results: Since MSI tumors are known to have a distinct immunologic profile, we separated them into their own group and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the MSS tumors. We identified a set of immune hot MSS tumors (n = 7) with extensive immune infiltration. These tumors had low TMB and were predominantly classified as CMS4 (5/7). None of the 12 patients in the combined MSI and immune hot MSS groups recurred during the length of our study and they had response rates > 50% (vs. < 25% in the rest of MSS patients). MSI and immune hot MSS tumors had lower frequency of TP53 and APC mutations, and they exhibited increased levels of T cell infiltration. In particular, we observed overexpression of markers for Th1 cells, which produce inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma) and are associated with antitumor immunity. Genes encoding protein targets of immune checkpoint blockade, such as PDCD1 (PD-1), CD274 (PD-L1), CTLA4, HAVCR2 (TIM3) and LAG3, were also overexpressed in the immune hot MSS and - to a lesser extent – the MSI tumors, suggesting that these patients might benefit from the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusions: Our results uncover a unique LARC tumor immune profile evident in the pre-treatment setting that could be used to better prognosticate rectal cancer patients and develop novel therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "  '156Background: Emerging evidence suggests subsets of the Hippo pathway have multiple functions of tumor development and immune response regulation. Increased understanding of the molecular characteristics of its signaling pathways and the impact on immune cell trafficking will be critical to develop colorectal cancer (CRC) therapies. Methods: A total of 13,008 CRC tumors were analyzed at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ) with whole transcriptome and whole exome sequencing (NovaSeq). MSI-H/dMMR was tested by NGS (next generation sequencing), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fragment analysis. Tumor mutational burden (TMB)-High was determined with a 10-mt/MB cutoff. RNA-deconvolution using QuantiSEQ was used to assess immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. Consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) were developed using RNA expression data. Gene expression was reported as transcripts per million. Z-score totals of 6 core Hippo genes were calculated in groups: MST1+STK3 (G1), LATS1+LATS2 (G2), YAP1+WWTR1 (G3), and all 6 genes together (G4). Tumors with bottom quartile (QL) z-scores were compared with the top quartile (QH) using χ2/Fisher-Exact test and adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg method: adjusted p <.05 was considered significant; unadjusted p <.05 trending. Results: Gene expression levels were significantly positively correlated with each other (Spearman rho: 0.30–0.78). Highest expression levels of G1–4 were seen in CMS4 and lowest in CMS3 with significant differences. MSI-H/dMMR were significantly higher in QL than QH in all (G1: 7.4 vs 4.9%, G2: 7.4 vs 4.5, G3: 8.7 vs 4.1, G4: 7.5 vs 4.5). TMB-H prevalence (%) showed inverse relationships with MSI-H significantly in G1–3 (G1: 10.7 vs 7.5, G2: 10.5 vs 7.1, G3: 12.7 vs 6.2) and trending in G4 (11.0 vs 7.0, p =.006). Considering only MSS tumors, TMB-H trended more often in QL than QH in G1, 3, and 4 (3.6–3.7 vs 2.2–2.6). PD-L1 expression by IHC was significantly higher in QH than QL in all (5.3 vs 3.3%) and MSS tumors (2.2 vs 4.2) only in G3. Z-scores of G1–4 were all positively correlated with immune cell infiltrations. Significantly higher fractions of B cells, M2 macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells were seen in QH than QL with a median fold change of 1.39. G1–4 z-scores all positively correlated with the expression of the analyzed immune-related genes. The highest Spearman rho averages were in HAVCR2 (0.54), CD86 (0.54), CD80 (0.53), PD-L2 (0.5), CD274 (0.46), and LAG3 (0.36). Significantly different mutation rates were seen in QH compared to QL in G1 (TP53, KRAS, PIKCA, SMAD2, AMER1), G2 (APC), G3 (PIK3CA, APC), and G4 (TP53, PIK3CA, KRAS). Conclusions: The Hippo pathway correlated with immune cell trafficking suggesting that YAP1/TAZ signaling may play a critical role in the immune responses. These findings may help develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting the Hippo pathway combined with immune therapies in CRC.',\n",

       "  '157Background: Pembrolizumab did not improve neoadjuvant rectal score when added to neoadjuvant CRT in the NRG-GI002 study. The impact of CRT on TME in patients (pts) with rectal cancer (RC) has not been well characterized. Methods: We performed a paired analysis on RC tissue taken pre- and post-CRT from pts undergoing long course CRT with a fluoropyrimidine followed by surgery. Samples underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) and whole transcriptome RNAseq. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB), and xCell algorithm were used to dissect TME changes pre/post-CRT. Results: Specimens from 61 pts with MSS-RC were identified: median age, 61y, 75% white, 18% black, and 57% male. Tumor samples from 57 pts underwent NGS: 43 pre-CRT, 48 post-CRT, and 34 paired. A total of 2,642 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between pre/post CRT tumors and then grouped into 3 main gene sets (GS): “higher eukaryotes transcription factor (E2F) target”, “G2/M cell cycle checkpoint”, and “Immune/Stress”. The 3 GS are mutually exclusive, indicating different cellular processes in response to CRT. E2F and G2/M gene signatures were specifically enriched pre-CRT (p < 0.0001), indicating that treatment alters cell survival, proliferation, and tumor growth. Cell death and apoptosis (p < 0.0001) and the Immune/Stress set, including stromal stress response (p = 0.0004), tissue repair (p = 0.0025), and leukocyte production (p < 0.008), were significantly enriched post-CRT. The xCell algorithm used to assess alteration stromal vs immune response by CRT; Stromal scores increased by 0.100 ± 0.016-fold, while Immune scores increased by 0.047 ± 0.017 (P = 0.015), suggesting a rise in Immune/Stress GS is driven mainly by stromal stress response. The 5 most common gene types upregulated post-CRT were smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, interstitial dendritic cells, pericytes, and hepatic stellate cells. However, immune alterations trended downward (NK, Th1, and gamma delta T cells) or rose heterogeneously, e.g., a rise in intra-tumoral CD8 T cell subsets (effector, effector memory, or central memory) occurred for 8/35 pts. Fifteen pts (42%) relapsed and/or died after surgery. While CD8 T cell infiltration tends to be associated with better prognosis, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.2277; HR 2.709). CD8 T cell infiltrates were associated with higher prevalence of immune checkpoint transcripts LAG3 (p = < 0.0001) and to a lesser extend PD1 (p = 0.0186) in the tumor, indicating an anergic state of CD8 T cell infiltrates post-CRT. Conclusions: TME of RC tumors mainly identified stress/ wound healing response to CRT. Immune response was heterogeneous among pts; a subset showed a significant rise in CD8 T cell infiltration, indicating an anergic state mainly driven by LAG3. The potential of this pt subset to respond to anti-LAG3 immunotherapy is worthy of further study.',\n",

       "  '158Background: Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers worldwide. Previous studies found that Ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1) and Ladybird homeobox 2 (LBX2), were involved in the progress of several types of cancer. However, studies on their roles in cancers, such as COAD, are very limited. Thus, this study was performed to explore their roles in COAD. Methods: RNA-sequencing FPKM data and corresponding clinical information of 480 tumor tissues of COAD and 41 normal tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The ‘limma’ package was used to compare the expression differences of LBX1 and LBX2 between the normal and cancer tissues using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Analysis of overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), and progression free interval (PFI) were conducted by Kaplan–Meier (K–M) method via ‘survminer’ package. Univariate Cox hazard regression analysis of OS was applied to five clinicopathological variables from T stage, N stage, M stage, pathologic stage, CEA level, as well as the expression level of family members of LBX that are overexpressed and associated with worsening survival outcomes, by using ‘survival’ package. Furthermore, a nomogram was also visualized by the R ‘rms’ package and ‘survival’ package to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and individual predictors. Results: The expression of LBX2 (p = 8.1e-20) was upregulated in COAD tissues compared with normal tissues, while no statistically significant difference of expression between normal tissues and tumor was found for LBX1 (p = 0.06). Further survival analysis found that higher expression of LBX2 was associate with worse OS (HR = 2.45, 95%CI 1.62-3.71, p < 0.001), DSS (HR = 2.34, 95%CI 1.39-3.96, p = 0.001), and PFI (HR = 1.48, 95%CI 1.04-2.10, p = 0.03). Univariate Cox hazard regression analysis showed that N1, N2, N3, M1, pathologic stage III and IV, CEA level&gt;5, and high expression level of LBX2 were associated with worse OS (all p < 0.05). The nomogram based on six clinicopathological variables (T stage, N stage, M stage, pathologic stage, CEA level, and LBX2 expression level) and 1-, 3-, 5-year OS probabilities were developed, with concordance index (C-index) of 0.795(0.755-0.834), indicating its prediction value and sufficient discrimination ability, as C-index was more than 0.7. The calibration curves of 1-, 3-, and 5-year demonstrated the consistency of our results and the predictive values, indicating satisfactory performance for this nomogram. Moreover1-, 3-, 5-year AUCs of LBX2-based nomogram were 0.805, 0.831, and 0.774, showing a moderate accuracy. Conclusions: LBX2 are upregulated in COAD tumor samples, and its higher expression is associated with worsening OS, DSS, and PFI. The LBX2-based monogram developed by this study might help predict the OS possibilities for COAD patients. LBX2 can be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker, and therapeutic marker in COAD.',\n",

       "  '159Background: Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common cancer in gastrointestinal tract. CDC-like kinase (CLK) family, containing four characterized isoforms (CLK1-4), have been reported for their roles in precursor-mRNA splicing. However, studies on their roles in COAD are limited. Thus, this study was performed to explore the roles of CLK family members in COAD. Methods: RNA-sequencing FPKM data and corresponding clinical information of 41 normal tissues and 480 tumor tissues of COAD were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then expression differences of CLK family between the normal tissues and COAD cancer tissues were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test via ‘limma’ package. Overall survival (OS) of upregulated CLK family members was analyzed by Kaplan–Meier (K–M) method via ‘survminer’ package. Subgroup analyses of different genders were also conducted. The best discriminate cut-off point between the high and low expression groups was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) values for upregulated CLK family members via ‘pROC’ package to assess their diagnostic values. Results: The expression of CLK1 and CLK2 were upregulated in tumors compared with normal tissues (p < 0.001), while CLK3 were downregulated in tumor tissues (p = 0.02) and no statically significant difference was found regarding CLK4 (p = 0.25). Higher expression of CLK1 was not associated with a change of OS (HR: 1.24, 95%CI: 0.84-1.83, p = 0.279), while higher expression of CLK2 is associated with worse OS (HR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.34-3.06, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis found that higher expression of CLK2 was associated with worse OS (HR: 2.28, 95%CI 1.27-4.08, p = 0.006) in males, but not in females (HR: 1.72, 95%CI 0.95-3.10, P = 0.072). Further analysis of ROC curve shown that AUC of CLK1 and CLK2 were 0.748 (0.687-0.809) and 0.884 (0.840-0.928), respectively. Conclusions: CLK1 and CLK2 are upregulated in COAD tumor samples, and higher expression of CLK2 in male COAD patients is associated worse OS. This demonstrated the potential therapeutic value of CLK2 in male patients with COAD. ROC curve indicated the potential diagnostic value of CLK1 and CLK2.',\n",

       "  '160Background: c-Ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) rearrangements have been reported in colorectal cancer (CRC), but little is known about the molecular and clinical features of ROS1-driven CRC and the response to ROS1-targeted treatment in CRC patients. Methods: We report disease course and treatment response of an index patient with chemotherapy-refractory right-sided metastatic CRC, harboring an activating ROS1 fusion (GOPC-ROS1). Moreover, we examined 40,589 patients with CRC who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling as part of routine clinical care at Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, MA); all classes of alterations in at least 324 genes were assessed, including ROS1. Results: The index patient experienced a rapid and sustained partial response to molecularly targeted treatment with crizotinib. After 15 months on crizotinib, disseminated tumor progression occurred, with KRAS Q61H emerging in tumor tissue (53.7% variant allele frequency (VAF)) and liquid biopsy (13.5% VAF). Within the clinical cohort, ROS1 genomic rearrangements (ROS1 RE (+)) were identified in 34 out of 40,589 (0.08%) CRC samples. GOPC-ROS1 was the most commonly identified ROS1 fusion (11/34 samples), followed by TTC28-ROS1 (3/34 samples). All ROS1-alterations were found in microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRCs, and ROS1 genomic alterations were significantly enriched in KRAS wild type tumors (KRAS mutations in 23.5% of ROS1 RE(+) vs. 49.8% of ROS1 RE(-), p=0.003). Conclusions: ROS1 rearrangements represent rare but clinically actionable molecular driver alterations in MSS CRCs. The detection of ROS1 fusion oncogenes in CRC can pose diagnostic challenges since intrachromosomal ROS1 fusions including GOPC-ROS1 and non-canonical ROS1 fusions such as TTC28-ROS1 can remain negative on fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry assays, respectively. NGS-based comprehensive molecular profiling may be a useful tool to screen for rare fusion oncogenes.',\n",

       "  '161Background: ̃80% of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) can be cured by surgery alone. However, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high risk features such as bowel obstruction, < 12 lymph nodes examined and T4 tumors. Traditional pathological grading and biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen has limited sensitivity. Several reports indicated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may represent a promising prognostic factor to assess MRD as a factor for prediction of recurrence after surgery. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study for the development of a novel plasma-based highly sensitive Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel using SafeSEQ technology in operable CRC Japanese patients. Methods: This multicenter prospective study recruited patients diagnosed as operable clinical stage II CRC (n = 46) with pre- and post- (4̃6 weeks) operative plasma samples collected between Nov, 2019 and Jan, 2021. ctDNA were extracted and a 14-gene NGS panel was used to analyze single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Indels covered by gene-specific amplicons. MRD variant was defined as same variant detected in both pre- and post- operative plasma samples. Tissue NGS by a 500-gene panel was also performed in a small number of tissue samples (n = 5) to compare the concordance of plasma and tissue variants. Results: Pre- and post-operative ctDNA status of 46 patients were analyzed. ctDNA positive was observed in 69.6% (32/46, 95%CI 55.2, 81.0) pre- and 34.8% (16/46, 95%CI 22.7, 49.3) post- samples. AKT1, CTNNB1, NRAS, POLE and PPP2R1A mutation were not detected in this study. TP53 mutation was most frequently detected in both pre- (22/46) and post- (11/46) samples, whereas APC mutation was ranked 2nd in pre- (15/46) but none in post- samples. A combined 96 variants were detected in all samples, in which 76 of them were < 0.5% mutant allele frequency (MAF). MRD variants were detected in 17.4% (8/46, 95%CI 8.82, 30.99) post- samples. Evaluation of positive percentage agreement between tissue and pre- plasma samples in three patients show that a total 7 variants detected in plasma, and 3 of them were detected in tissue samples. Conclusions: This study assesses the feasibility of a plasma-informed NGS panel by evaluating pre- and post- operative plasma samples. The presence of variants with < 0.5% MAF detected in this study indicate a highly sensitive method is required for accurate MRD detection. Further observation is required to explore the relationship between MRD variant and clinical outcome such as 2-year progression-free survival.',\n",

To identify whether detection of a BRAF V600E mutation in baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) correlated with response, we evaluated the status and allele frequency of BRAF V600E compared with clinical outcomes. Methods: Plasma samples were collected at Cycle 1 Day 1 and end of treatment for ctDNA analysis and analyzed using GuardantOMNI. Variant allele frequency (VAF) of BRAF V600E was grouped into high (> median) and low (≤median) categories. Low VAF samples included those where BRAF V600E mutation was not detected or no ctDNA was detected. ORR, based on blinded independent central review, and OS were compared between treatment arms according to VAF levels. ORR comparisons used Chi-square test and logistic regression. OS was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method. HRs and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox model. Additional correlation analyses between BRAF V600E status in baseline tumor tissue, as well as clonality, will be presented. Results: Baseline plasma samples were analyzed from 544 of 631 pts in the ctDNA analysis: 88.3% (196/222) in the triplet arm, 86.6% (187/216) in the doublet arm, and 83.4% (161/193) in the control arm. BRAF V600E mutations were detected in 90.4% (492/544) of pts (90.3% [177/196] triplet, 90.4% [169/187] doublet, and 90.7% [146/161] control). Pts with BRAF V600E mutations with high VAF had significantly (P≤0.0001) increased ORR (95% CI) in the triplet and doublet arms (27.3% [19.5–36.8] and 15.9% [9.7–25.0], respectively) compared with control (0% [0.0–4.3]). Similar response trends were observed in pts with BRAF V600E mutations with low VAF (triplet: 28.9% [20.8–38.9]; doublet: 25.3% [17.7–34.6]; control: 5.3% [2.1–12.8]). OS decreased in BRAF V600E pts with high VAF (median OS [95% CI]: triplet 7.2 [6.0–8.0] months, n = 99; doublet 5.4 [4.4–6.1] months, n = 88; control 4.2 [3.4–4.8] months, n = 85) compared with pts with low VAF (triplet 14.8 [10.2–19.8] months, n = 97; doublet 14.8 [11.7–23.0] months, n = 99; control 9.3 [7.5–11.3] months, n = 76). Conclusions: ctDNA analyses showed the majority of pts in BEACON analyzed at baseline had a detectable BRAF V600E mutation. Increased response rates were observed in pts treated with triplet or doublet therapy compared with control, independent of VAF. Pts with a higher VAF for BRAF V600E may have a worse prognosis.

       "  '163Background: Changes in the colon’s microbiota composition are contributors to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Features of this microbiome may have prognostic significance. For this study, we analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from tumor tissue samples of advanced CRC patients and determined if there were potential correlations between microbiome composition and clinical outcomes. Methods: One hundred and thirty three advanced CRC patients in St. Vincent’s Hospital in Korea were enrolled. DNA was extracted from collected tissue samples, the V3-V4 regions were amplified, and a 16S rRNA gene amplicon library was prepared using an Illumina protocol. DNA was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. We used three different bioinformatic packages to process the sequence data and evaluate the microbiome composition of each tumor. Results: The classification performances of three different analytic pipelines (Kraken2, QIIME2, and DADA2) were compared in a microbiome control sample. Among these, DADA2 and QIIME2 were chosen for use in subsequent analysis, due to their lower Chi-square (χ2) test statistic values on the control data. After excluding samples that retained less than 5% of total reads after merging, 120 samples were analyzed. The median age of the cohort was 63 years, 63.3% were male, and all were Korean. The distribution over primary sites was 27.5% from the right-side colon, 30.8% from the left-side colon, and 41.7% from the rectum. All subjects received the first line of systemic treatment. The median progression-free survival time was 8.9 months. Twenty-nine patients (24.2%) survived more than 24 months. When examining the results from the two bioinformatic packages, pairwise comparisons showed positive correlations in the relative abundances of the top 20 genera. Fusobacterium, a microbe known to relate to pathogenesis and prognosis of CRC, was not detected by QIIME2. Stratifying by primary site, rectal cancers showed higher alpha diversity than left- or right-side colon cancers. Separately, a higher serum CEA level (≥8) at diagnosis, and the presence of lung metastasis were both found to be related to higher alpha-diversity, a global indicator of microbiome composition. When excluding minimally abundant (< 1% per patient) genera, beta-diversity was found to be differentiable by T stage, the presence of lung metastasis, and the presence of liver metastasis. Most notably, beta-diversity differed between patients who survived more than two years and patients who died within 2 years. Using the DADA2 results, we confirmed that the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum in CRC tissue was found to be a strong predictor of poor overall survival (OS), along with old age and liver metastasis. Conclusions: This study suggests potential associations between microbiome composition and clinical parameters of advanced CRC. Microbial biomarkers may be a valuable prognostic tool in this population.',\n",

       "  '164Background: Adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancer prevents recurrence by eliminating minimal residual disease. However, patients who are at high risk of recurrence after completing standard adjuvant therapy are currently unknown. Although ascites CEA level has been associated with long-term oncologic outcomes, the clinical significance of ascites CEA in high-risk stage II and stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been described. The present study aimed to determine the long-term oncologic impacts of ascites CEA level after curative colorectal cancer. Methods: A total of 191 patients with stage II/III CRC were included in this study, between January 2015 and December 2018. CEA of peritoneal fluid sampled at the beginning of each operation was analyzed. long-term oncologic outcomes were analyzed with the known risk factors for recurrence in CRC. Results: Multivariate analysis of recurrence revealed that lymphatic invasion (HR 6.0, 95% CI 1.1–32.0, p = 0.04), vascular invasion (HR 2.9, 95%CI 1.0–8.0, p = 0.04), mucinous cancer (HR 5.5, 95% CI 1.6–18.4, p = 0.006), and peritoneal fluid CEA above 5 ng/dl (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.2–15.0, p = 0.008) were significant risk factors (Table). Peritoneal fluid cytology, microsatellite instability, cancer obstruction did not significantly impact DFS in stage II/III CRC. There were 14 patients with liver metastasis, among them, 11 patients without peritoneal metastasis; they had high ascites CEA level. While 8 patients had lung metastasis, 7 of them confirmed high ascites CEA levels. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the ascites CEA may predict as an important biomarker to identify those at risk of distant metastasis in high-risk stage II and stage III CRC patients. We suggest ascites CEA analysis might be included in patient risk assessments and oncologic prediction tools.',\n",

       "  '165Background: Up to 50% of patients with Colorectal Cancer (CRC) will metastasise to the liver (CRLM). KRAS-mt liver metastases particularly when co-mutated with TP53 are associated with poor prognosis. We have used the Glasgow Microenvironment Score (GMS), a histological score performed on H+E slides utilising immune and stromal components of the microenvironment to robustly stratify outcome in primary CRC. The aim of the current study was firstly to determine the utility of GMS in metastatic CRC and secondly to employ the NanostringTM GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP), a state-of-the art analysis platform enabling spatial transcriptomic characterisation while maintaining tumour microenvironment (TME) topographical features, to interrogate the functional biology underlying the GMS. Methods: FFPE specimens from primary and metastatic lesions from 44 patients undergoing synchronous resection of CRLM underwent GMS, IHC and panel genomic assessment. Primary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). In addition to bulk transcriptomic assessment, 4 matched pairs from the cohort were selected for GeoMx analysis: 2 samples were GMS0 (high-immune) and 2 were GMS1 (low-immune) with an equal distribution of KRASmt and wt. After multiplex IF staining (PanCK, CD45, DAPI, αSMA), 48 regions of interest were selected and Cancer Transcriptome Atlas Transcriptomic outputs (2000 genes) were analysed using Pathway enrichment analysis with immune deconvolution of the transcriptome performed. Results: GMS0 (high-immune) was associated with improved RFS (p=0.0048) and CSS (p=0.0012) remaining an independent predictor of survival on multivariate analysis (HR 2.90, 95% C.I 1.18-7.16 P=0.021). GMS0 lesions were enriched for adaptive immune (NES=2.20 p.adj<0.0005) and IL-10 (NES=1.9 p.adj<0.0005) pathways specifically at the invasive edge. In contrast, a poor prognostic KRAS/TP53 lesion demonstrated profound immunosuppression, upregulated NOTCH signalling (NES=2.13 p.adj<0.0005) and neutrophil degranulation (NES=1.99 p.adj<0.0005). Topographical Immune-cell deconvolution demonstrated significantly higher populations of CD4 (p=0.05) and CD8 (p=0.0003) cells in GMS0 leading edges. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that spatial transcriptomic analysis using the Nanostring GeoMx tool can reveal potential novel mechanisms underlying biologically relevant histological and mutational subgroups (KRAS-mt) of CRC, providing potential therapeutic targets requiring further investigation.

       "  '166Background: Rectal cancer constitutes over one-third of all colorectal cancers (CRC) and is one of the leading cause of cancer-related death in developed countries. Treatment modalities applied in locally advanced tumors differ substantially among research centers. In order to identify high-risk patients and better adjust the therapy new markers are needed. Systemic inflammatory response (SIR) markers such as LMR, NLR and PLR have been proved highly prognostic in many malignancies, including CRC; however, they lack proper validation. In our study we assessed the reproducibility of LMR, NLR and PLR. Methods: Sixty patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated in Maria-Sklodowska Curie National Institute of Oncology in Warsaw, Poland between 08.2017 and 12.2020 were prospectively enrolled in the study. Three consecutive blood morphology tests of each patient within a median period of 21 days were obtained before start of the treatment. Results: LMR, NLR and PLR calculated at two time-points were correlated with the coefficient of 0.776, 0.696 and 0.751 (p < 0.005 in all measurements), respectively. Patients were divided into LMR, NLR, PLR-high and low groups. If LMR at the first test was out of the range of 2.2-3.0 (+/- 0.4 from the cut-off) the risk of misclassification in the second measurement defined as an affiliation to a different (high or low) group than initially was 5.0% (95% CI 1.0-13.9%). In case of NLR, when outside of the range of 2.5-3.5 (+/- 0.5) it was 8.3% (95% CI 2.8-18.4%) and PLR outside of the range of 125-175 (+/- 25) 10.0% (95% CI 3.8-20.5%). Mean percentage change between the third and the first measurement of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets count ranged from -5.59% to 4.76% and the standard error from 2.0 to 3.9. Conclusions: In conclusion SIR markers are reproducible, easily obtained biomarkers with potential application in clinical practice.',\n",

       "  '167Background: The incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer (yoCRC) is rising for unknown reasons. This study assessed for differences in comprehensive genomic profiles between yoCRC and average-onset colorectal cancer (aoCRC). Methods: All patients with CRC seen at Cleveland Clinic that had tumor-based next generation sequencing (NGS) performed as part of their care with a clinically available assay between January 2017 and September 2020 were included. The cohort was divided based on age of diagnosis, with yoCRC defined as age of CRC diagnosis <50 years old. All clinical data and genomic alterations were included for analysis. We assessed for differences in clinical data and NGS findings between yoCRC and aoCRC using Fisher’s exact test, adjusted for primary tumor sidedness. Overall survival (OS) by genomic alteration was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and compared using log rank test. Results: The study population comprised of 51 yoCRC patients and 211 aoCRC patients. There were no significant differences in sex, race or ethnicity between yoCRC and aoCRC patients. Compared to aoCRC patients, yoCRC patients were more likely to present at diagnosis with stage IV disease (81% vs. 56%, p = 0.02) and have left-sided primary tumors (69% vs. 60%, p = 0.26). YoCRC tumors were more likely to have mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53 and FLT3 compared to aoCRC tumors, independent of tumor sidedness. These data are summarized in Table. Compared to left-sided tumors, right-sided tumors had significantly higher frequency of KRAS (67.7% vs. 48.8%, p = 0.003), BRAF (15.2% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.0006) and PTEN (16.2% vs. 3.1%, p value = 0.0003) alterations. AoCRC patients had significantly longer OS compared to yoCRC patients (median OS: 70.0 months vs. 36.3 months, p=0.004). Black (37.2 months, n=35) and Asian (37.8 months, n=7) patients had significantly worse median OS compared to White patients (67.8 months, n=199), p-value 0.005. In the overall population, patients with APC mutations had significantly better OS compared to those with APC wildtype tumors (median OS: 92.6 months vs. 54.4 months, p=0.001). Patients with FLT3 mutations had worse median OS compared to those with FLT3 wildtype tumors (median OS: 42.0 months vs. 64.8 months, p=0.007). There were no survival differences based on MSI status. Conclusions: In this series, yoCRC patients were more likely to present with stage IV disease and experienced worse OS compared to aoCRC patients. YoCRC patients were more likely to have mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53 and FLT3, independent of tumor sidedness.

       "  '168Background: Identifying molecular residual disease (MRD) using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis after curative surgery can potentially stratify the recurrence risk and facilitate personalization of adjuvant treatment in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a prospective study “COSMOS-CRC-01” to evaluate the utility of a plasma-only ctDNA assay integrating genomic and epigenomic signatures. Methods: Patients with resectable clinical stage 0–III colorectal cancer were eligible. Plasma samples were collected at structured pre- and post-surgical timepoints and analyzed using Guardant Reveal, a plasma-only ctDNA assay that detects the presence of MRD by identifying somatic alterations and methylation signatures of cell-free DNA associated with colorectal cancer. Results: As of April 2021, 501 patients were enrolled in the COSMOS-CRC-01, of which 496 patients had their post-operative 4-week ctDNA status. In this analysis, we included the first 100 patients enrolled with clinical stage II or more CRC. Seven patients were excluded due to non-curative resection or pathological stage (pStage) IV. The assay was able to produce a result for all 93 samples analyzed (failure rate of 0%). MRD was detected in 23 (25%) patients 4 weeks after surgery. The MRD detection rate was 20% in pStage II disease and 29% in pStage III disease. Patients with positive MRD were older than those with negative MRD (p = 0.0001). Across all MRD positive samples, 30%, 9%, and 61% were positive by both genomic and epigenomic, only genomic, and only epigenomic calls. Genomic signatures included APC, BRAF, KRAS, and TP53 mutations with the lowest variant allelic fraction of 0.04%. With a median follow-up time of 12.2 months (range 8-18 months), 9 of 93 patients recurred (9.7%). ctDNA was detected from a single 4-week post-surgical sample in 55% of patients who recurred (5 of 9). 1-year disease-free survival was 81.2% in patients with positive MRD and 93.9% in those with negative MRD (hazard ratio 3.49, 95% CI 0.93–13.10, p = 0.049). Multivariate analysis including baseline characteristics associated with recurrence risk showed that MRD status had the strongest association with the recurrence. Post-operative 4-week serum CEA level was not associated with risk for recurrence. Conclusions: While follow-up in this cohort is currently limited, the results suggest that a single post-surgery sample run on a plasma-only assay that integrates genomic and epigenomic signatures can more accurately stratify patients with CRC by recurrence risk than previously known clinical factors. Data from baseline and longitudinal timepoints will be reported as available along with longer term clinical follow-up. Clinical trial information: UMIN000037765.',\n",

       "  '169Background: Detection and treatment of early colorectal cancer (CRC) or advanced adenomas (AA) is the key for superior outcomes and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT)-based screening has proven effective in reducing CRC death and the risk of advanced-stage CRC but the discrepancy in the effectiveness was observed between proximal and distal cancers. On the other hand, false-positive results of FIT with 60 % of negative colonoscopy is another concern, considering the burden to the screening participants and the healthcare providers. A blood-based test as an alternative or supplement to FIT has the potential to concurrently enhance the detection of high-risk neoplasms and identify individuals at risk who should then be referred to colonoscopy. We investigated the levels of circulating free nucleosomes containing different epigenetic modifications in patients referred for colonoscopy. Methods: 10mls whole blood was obtained from 520 asymptomatic patients prior to colonoscopy at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients were classified into 5 groups based on their colonoscopy reports: (i) patient with CRC (n = 33), (ii) patients with AA (n = 123, including 18 with AA > 2cm); (iii) patients with non-AA (n = 168); (iv) patients with non-neoplastic polyps (n = 30); (vi) healthy controls with no endoscopic lesion (n = 166). Plasma samples were analyzed for nucleosome levels using 7 different quantitative immunoassays (Nu.Q assays; Belgian Volition SRL, Belgium) targeting H3.1-nucleosomes or different histone modifications (H3K27Me3-, H3K36Me3-, H3K9Me3-, H3K14Ac-, H3K27Ac- or H3R8Cit-nucleosomes). All study subjects were asked to collect a stool sample at home within 48-hours before the colonoscopy. The fecal samples were assayed with the Eiken OC-SENSOR FIT kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for all study subjects. Results: At a cut-off of 20µg/g feces, the FIT test showed a sensitivity of 92,9% at 17.5% specificity for CRC +AA vs. Controls. All the CRC patients and 83.3% of the high-risk AA (> 2cm) patients were FIT positive. A combination of 2 Nu.Q biomarkers: H3K27Me3 and H3R8Cit with FIT in a logistic regression model showed improved sensitivity of 95% at 20.6% specificity allowing the detection of all CRC patients and 94.3% of AA patients including all the high-risk adenomas. The FIT test detected 46 out of 55 proximal adenomas whereas the combined model could detect 50 proximal adenomas including 3 proximal AA > 2cm not being detected by FIT (p < 0.05). The same combination would reduce unnecessary colonoscopies by 21.8% of the control and 23.3% of the non-neoplastic polyps subgroups compared to 17.5% and 6.7%, respectively with the FIT test alone. Conclusions: Our results indicate that H3K27Me3 and H3R8Cit-nucleosome levels in combination with FIT could improve the detection of proximal high-risk AA and could also provide a non-invasive method to reduce unnecessary colonoscopy.',\n",

       "  '170Background: The effectiveness of screening using either fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) or colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality has been demonstrated in previous studies. Nevertheless, the single test sensitivity of FIT for relevant precursor lesions, especially high-risk neoplasms like invasive cancer or advanced adenomas (AA), is a concern. Improving the sensitivity for high-risk neoplasm is critical to improving the effectiveness of screening in reducing CRC incidence and mortality. Dysregulation of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been linked with several cancers including CRC. We investigated the clinical performance of circulating nucleosome levels containing specific histone PTMs in blood, in combination with FIT from symptomatic subjects referred to colonoscopy to evaluate their discriminant power towards CRC and AA. Methods: 10mls whole blood was obtained prior to colonoscopy from 476 patients referred to colonoscopy in National Taiwan University Hospital for surveillance or secondary to bowel symptoms. Patients were classified into 5 groups based on their colonoscopy reports: (i) patient with CRC (n = 67), (ii) patients with AA (n = 60, including 22 with AA≥2cm); (iii) patients with non-AA (n = 123); (iv) patients with non-neoplastic polyps (n = 29); (vi) healthy controls with no endoscopic lesion (n = 197). Plasma samples were analyzed for nucleosome levels using 7 different quantitative immunoassays (Nu.Q assays; Belgian Volition SRL, Belgium) targeting H3.1-nucleosomes or different histone modifications (H3K27Me3-, H3K36Me3-, H3K9Me3-, H3K14Ac-, H3K27Ac- or H3R8Cit-nucleosomes). All study subjects were asked to collect a stool sample at home within 48-hours before the colonoscopy. The fecal samples were assayed with the OC-SENSOR FIT kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for all subjects. Results: At a cut-off of 20µg/g feces, the FIT test showed a sensitivity of 83.5% at 82.1% specificity for CRC +AA vs. Controls. All the CRC patients were detected but 35% of AA were missed, and 7 of which were high-risk adenomas (AA≥2cm). A combination of 2 Nu.Q biomarkers: H3K36Me3 and H3K9Me3 with FIT in a decision tree model showed an improved sensitivity of 98.4% allowing the detection of all CRC patients and 97% of the patients with AA including all high-risk adenomas. The 2 missed AA were one AA below 1cm and one between 1 and 2cm. Unnecessary colonoscopies could be reduced by 28.9% of the control and 20.7% of the non-neoplastic polyps subgroups as both are found negative with this panel of assays. Conclusions: At present, all the symptomatic patients are sent to colonoscopy in clinical practice. Our results indicate that H3K36Me3- and H3K9Me3-nucleosome levels, in combination with FIT in a decision tree model, could detect all CRC patients and all high-risk adenomas and help reduce unnecessary colonoscopies.',\n",

       "  '171Background: Mutational profiling is recommended for selecting targeted therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Evidence suggests that among patients with mutations in one of three RAS genes who underwent resection of liver metastasis, those with early onset mCRC had worse outcomes compared to those with late onset mCRC. The goal of this study was to explore whether other mutated genes in mCRC exhibit an association between age and wild type versus mutant RAS status. Methods: Between October 2018 and October 2020, 974 tumor samples from patients with mCRC were identified. Samples meeting requirements were profiled with the Oncotype MAP Pan-Cancer Tissue test, which sequences 257 genes from tumor tissue, including all 3 RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, NRAS). Using the Oncotype MAP assay, single base variants, indels, copy number alterations and structural variants/fusions were identified. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) were also determined. To identify genes for which there was an association between age group (patients ≤50 years vs >50 years) and RAS status we used Fisher’s Exact Test. Results: Of the 974 samples, 840 met minimum tumor tissue requirements for DNA sequencing (3mm2 and 15% tumor cellularity). Of these, 759 samples were successfully sequenced for NGS. Median turnaround time from the date of sample accessioning to the date of laboratory report was 5 days (interquartile range, IQR, 4-6 days). TMB varied from 0-227 mutations per megabase (median 6, IQR 4-8), and was high (≥10 mut/Mb) in 117 samples (15%). Of 775 specimens processed for MSI, 714 could be measured and approximately 7% were MSI-high. A total of 496 RAS variants were identified, of which 391 were pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of unknown significance (349 KRAS, 34 NRAS, 8 HRAS). Of the 27 genes with at least 78 mutations in the data set, there was an association between RAS status and patient age for mutations at SMAD4, ABCC1, and RICTOR (Fisher’s Exact test, P < 0.05). For all three, mutations at these genes are relatively more prevalent in samples from young RAS wild type patients compared to young RAS mutant patients (Table). Conclusions: The Oncotype MAP Pan-Cancer Tissue test identified numerous genomic changes in mCRC samples. There appears to be an association between age group and RAS status for three mutated genes, SMAD4, ABCC1, and RICTOR. The clinical implication is unclear and warrants further investigation with outcomes data.Three genes appear to exhibit an association between RAS status (wild type vs mutant) and age (≤ 50 vs. >50).GENE (# mutated)Age ≤ 50Age > 50SMAD4 (N=109)\\u2003RAS Wt7 (26.9%)19 (73.1%)\\u2003RAS Mt6 (7.2%)77 (92.8%)ABCC1 (MRP1) (N=85)\\u2003RAS Wt7 (21.2%)26 (78.8%)\\u2003RAS Mt2 (3.8%)50 (96.2%)RICTOR (N=84)\\u2003RAS Wt7 (29.2%)17 (70.8%)\\u2003RAS Mt5 (8.3%)55 (91.7%)Mt = mutated, Wt = wild type.',\n",

       "  '172Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is the laboratory cornerstone of precision oncology treatment. In advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), current guidelines recommend testing RAS, BRAF and MMR biomarkers as standard of care. The added value of comprehensive genomic profiling is so far unclear. Traditional NGS operations are complicated, requiring specialized equipment and personnel. In many jurisdictions, cancer patients are treated in publicly-funded community hospitals, where NGS is not typically utilized and access to testing via send-out services is associated with lengthy turnaround times. Here, we have validated and implemented one of the world\\'s first \"point of care\" NGS services. Our early experience on NGS implementation and impact in CRC patients is described. Methods: All NGS studies were performed using the Oncomine Precision Assay (OPA) on the genexus integrated sequencer. NGS was performed at the request of the treating physician. All NGS was performed in a local community pathology lab by histotechnologists, simultaneously responsible for IHC testing (such as MMR) and interpreted by anatomic pathologists in conjunction with routine diagnostic pathology services. Retrospective chart review was performed for all patients undergoing sequencing studies and key data, including turnaround time and NGS findings were extracted from the electronic medical record for analysis. Results: A total of 51 cases with CRC were tested using point of care NGS from November 2020-August 2021, initiated by treating physicians. The median turnaround time for results was 3 days. Oncogenic driver events were identified in 46 (90%) cases, including canonical mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF (Table). Actionable mutations were identified in 13 (25%) samples that would not have been identified with single-gene testing. Conclusions: Here, we show that comprehensive NGS can reveal occult resistance mechanisms to standard therapy and identify actionable biomarkers in a substantial proportion of patients with CRC. NGS added valuable information compared to guideline-recommended testing standards. Our study demonstrates that local testing can have rapid turnaround times. To our knowledge, this is the first report of “point of care” NGS in CRC. Further follow up is needed to explore the utility of these expanded roles for NGS testing.

       "  '173Background: KRAS is the most common driver oncogene in mCRC. Comprehensive analysis of KRAS variants prevalence and the relationship between variants and outcomes are lacking. Herein, we aimed to examine the impact of KRAS variants on outcomes in patients (pts) with mCRC. Methods: A retrospective review of pts with mCRC with known KRAS mutation status was performed. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the association between KRAS variants. Cox Proportional Hazard modeling was used to study the relationship between KRAS variants and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess OS. Results: A total of 423 pts diagnosed with mCRC from 2014-2020 with available extended KRAS status were evaluated. Median age at diagnosis was 59.8 yrs (22.3-92 range), 57% were male, 22% were Black, and 75% presented with de novo metastatic disease. A majority (56%) of tumors harbored KRAS mutations. The most frequent KRAS variants were G12D 47% (111), G12V 12% (28), G12C 13% (31), G13D 9% (21), and 20% (47) were other variants. In univariate analyses, the presence of a KRAS mutation, Black race, de novo metastatic disease, age, receipt of chemotherapy, and receipt of surgery were associated with OS. Tumor location was not associated with OS. In multivariable analyses, mutation type was a significant predictor of death and the presence of G12D was associated with an increased risk of death compared to G12V and KRAS wildtype. There was no increased risk of death in pairwise comparisons of G12D and G13D or other KRAS variants. Black race, de novo metastatic disease, and no receipt of surgery were additional independent predictors of death (Table). With a median follow-up of 25.7 months (mo.), median OS was 35.5 mo. (95% CI 10.5-50.9) with G12C, Not Reached (NR) (95% CI 21-NR) with G12V, 36.2 mo. (95%CI 14.9-58.5) with G13D, 26.2 mo. (95% CI 21.8-37) with G12D, 39.6 mo. (95% CI 22.4-47.9) for other KRAS mutations, and 59.6 mo. (95%CI 48.2-NA) for KRAS wildtype, respectively (p=0.0003). Conclusions: Our findings highlight differences in unadjusted overall survival when comparing G12D to some other KRAS variants. Codon and amino acid-specific mutations of KRAS should be considered when evaluating prognosis and further study on treatment effects and sequencing is warranted.

       "  '174Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC), while one of the most common cancer diagnoses, can behave heterogeneously based on molecular characteristics. A subset of patients (pts) with CRC are characterized with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d), these pts exhibit encouraging responses to immunotherapy. The predictive nature of various factors, such as BRAF status, age, and MMR-D protein loss type, have been investigated in pts with MMR-d CRC. However, the prognostic role of these factors has not been well established. The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics that influence survival in MMR-d mCRC. Methods: This study evaluated pts with MMR-d mCRC in the Flatiron database. Overall survival (OS) was determined from date of diagnosis of stage IV disease to date of death and stratified based on age greater than or less than 50 years, BRAF mutation status, RAS mutation status, and type of MMR gene loss. For statistical analysis, the Chi-Square test was implemented to determine the prognostic significance of clinical and molecular features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were determined through the Cox regression model. Results: There were 1,101 pts in the study. The majority of pts were older than 50 (79.7%), Caucasian (75%), and had ECOG 0-1 (83.4%). Among the 803 pts with known BRAF status, 44.3% (n=356) had BRAF V600E mutation and 55.7% (n=447) were BRAF wildtype. Pts with BRAF V600E mutation had OS of 18.9 months vs. 33.2 months for pts with wild type BRAF (HR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.25-1.86, p<0.001). Pts older than 50 had a lower median OS vs. those who were ≤50 at 21.4 months vs. 38.7 months (HR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.33-2.07, p<0.001). When comparing MSH2/MSH6 mutations to MLH1/PMS2, a trend towards improved OS was seen with median survival of 35.2 months vs. 22.7 months, respectively (HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61-1.02, p=0.067). On multivariate analysis, BRAF mutation and older age continued to be associated with differences in survival, while KRAS mutation and specific MMR gene loss did not. Conclusions: BRAF V600E mutation and age greater than 50 are associated with decreased survival for pts with MMR-D mCRC. KRAS mutations and specific MMR alterations are not associated with differences in survival.',\n",

       "  '175Background: Colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) is a common cancer in gastrointestinal tract. Endonuclease V (ENDOV), an enzyme with specificity for deaminated adenosine (inosine) in nucleic acids, was found to be involved in the development of certain cancers. Thus, this study was performed to explore the effects of ENDOV on the prognosis of COAD. Methods: RNA-sequencing FPKM data and corresponding clinical information of 41 normal tissues and 480 tumor tissues of COAD were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then ENDOV expression differences between the normal and cancer tissues were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test via ‘limma’ package. Overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) analyses were conducted by Kaplan–Meier (K–M) method via ‘survminer’ package. Subgroup analyses of different genders were also performed. Results: The expression of ENDOV was downregulated in tumors compared with normal tissues (p < 0.001). However, higher expression of ENDOV is associated with worse OS (HR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.23-2.73, P = 0.003) and DSS (HR: 1.75, 95%CI 1.06-2.91, P = 0.03). Subgroup analysis found that higher expression of ENDOV was associated with worse OS (HR: 2.17, 95%CI 1.18-3.98, P = 0.012) in females, but not in males (HR: 1.48, 95%CI 0.86-2.53, P = 0.158). As for DSS, higher expression of ENDOV was also correlated with worse outcome (HR: 2.36, 95%CI 1.07-5.19, P = 0.033) in females, but not in males (HR: 1.45, 95%CI 0.73-2.86, P = 0.287). Conclusions: ENDOV is overall downregulated in COAD tumor samples. However, higher expression of ENDOV in certain COAD patients is associated worse OS and DSS in females but not in males. This indicates the potential role of ENDOV in predicating the prognosis of COAD in female patients.',\n",

       "  '176Background: ERBB2 is a rapidly emerging therapeutic target for a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) harboring oncogenic alterations in this gene. Oncogenic ERBB3 mutations have been reported in various cancers including CRC, but little is known about its functional impact. Optimal targeting of this pathway requires understanding of the genomic context in which somatic ERBB2/3 alterations (ERBB2/3-alt) occur in a real-world CRC population. Methods: We analyzed 7,688 de-identified records from CRC patients that underwent next generation sequencing with the Tempus|xT assay (DNA-seq of 648 genes at 500x coverage, full transcriptome RNA-seq). We assessed the prevalence and association of ERBB2/3-alt with demographics, co-occurring alterations, immuno-oncology biomarkers (microsatellite instability [MSI], tumor mutational burden [TMB], PD-L1 expression), and consensus molecular subtype (CMS, available for the subgroup with primary biopsies and RNA data [n = 2,686]). Results: Overall, 5% (376/7688) of tumors harbored an ERBB2 or ERBB3-alt. 1.9% (n = 143) ERBB2-amplified, 1.3% (n = 97) ERBB2-mutated, 0.9% (n = 72) ERBB3-mutated, < 1% other combinations (excluded from analyses). There were no significant differences in baseline demographics (e.g., age of onset, race and gender) between groups. Patients with ERBB2/3-alt were more likely to be MSI-high and TMB-high (Table). There was a trend towards higher prevalence of positive PD-L1 in ERBB3-alt vs ERBB3-WT tumors. We observed significant differences in co-occurring alterations among ERBB2/3-alt and WT groups (Table). CMS classification did not identify significant differences by ERBB2-alt or ERBB3-alt; ERBB2-alt compared to WT (CMS1: 8.6% vs 13%; CMS2: 24% vs 26%; CMS3: 20% vs 17%; CMS4: 30% vs 34%; p = 0.12) and ERBB3-alt compared to WT (CMS1: 24% vs 13%; CMS2: 12% vs 26%; CMS3: 16% vs 17%; CMS4: 40% vs 34%; p = 0.3). Conclusions: ERBB2/3 mutated CRC are more frequently MSI-H, TMB-high and KRAS mutated than ERBB2/3-WT tumors. Correlation of ERBB2/3 alterations with other genomic alterations including BRAF, TP53, CDK12, PIK3CA, and TOP2A will help advance the clinical development of HER2-targeted therapies.ERBB2 amplified (n = 143)ERBB2 mutated (n = 97)ERBB3 mutated (n = 72)ERBB2/3 WT (n = 7,312)p-valueImmuno-biomarkers\\u2003MSI-H0 (0%)12 (12%)15 (21%)404 (5.6%)< 0.001\\u2003TMB ≥104 (3.0%)17 (18%)20 (28%)675 (9.4%)< 0.001\\u2003PD-L1+4 (6.6%)1 (3.3%)3 (10%)205 (7.5%)0.8Co-mutated Genes\\u2003TP53115 (80%)59 (61%)42 (58%)4,234 (58%)< 0.001\\u2003CDK12101 (71%)1 (1.0%)0 (0%)37 (0.5%)< 0.001\\u2003KRAS15 (10%)48 (49%)41 (57%)2,764 (38%)< 0.001\\u2003PIK3CA12 (8.4%)16 (16%)20 (28%)950 (13%)< 0.001\\u2003BRAF1 (0.7%)5 (5.2%)2 (2.8%)525 (7.2%)0.010\\u2003TOP2A39 (27%)0 (0%)0 (0%)5 (< 0.1%)< 0.001',\n",

       "  '177Background: LRP1B is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family and a tumor suppressor found to be downregulated in colon cancer (CRC). GRM3 is a receptor of glutamate, an amino acid and neurotransmitter. Inhibition of GRM3 reduces CRC cell growth. Recent data from CALGB/SWOG 80405 suggests that mutations (MT) of either LRP1B or GRM3 are associated with better and worse overall survival (OS) in patients treated with bevacizumab (Bev), respectively. We investigate the association of LRP1B or GRM3 mRNA levels with outcomes. Methods: A total of 13,780 CRC tumors (male 7,497, female 6,283) underwent comprehensive molecular profiling (Caris Life Sciences). Analyses included next-generation sequencing of DNA (592 genes, NextSeq, WES, NovaSEQ) and RNA (NovaSeq). Significance with multiple correction was indicated with q, otherwise p value. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) were performed (significance p <.05). A Consensus Molecular Subtype (CMS) calling algorithm was developed using mRNA levels (transcripts per million; TPM). Time on treatment (TOT) with Bev was extracted from insurance claims. Results: Male patients had higher GRM3 expression (median TPM.55 vs..52, p <.001). GRM3 and LRP1B were both elevated in brain metastases (1.95 vs..40, q<.01;.53 vs..16, q<.01) and enriched in CMS4 subtype (both p <.001). Overexpression of GRM3 and LRP1B were significantly associated with MSS (.11 vs..07, p <.0001;.54 vs..39, p <.0001) and TMB low status (.11 vs..08, p <.0001;.54 vs..40, p <.0001). For MSS tumors, high LRP1B was associated with lower MT rates of APC (76% vs. 78%), KRAS (49% vs. 51%) and PIK3CA (15% vs. 17%). For MSI tumors, high LRP1B correlated with higher MT of MSH6 (41% vs. 32%), BRCA2 (28% vs. 20%) and PMS2 (12% vs. 6%). MSS tumors with high GRM3 had more APC (79% vs. 75%), less KRAS (47% vs. 52%) and SMAD4 (12% vs. 16%) MT and MSI with high GRM3 carried more APC (42% vs. 35%) and RAD50 (18% vs. 8%) MT. MSS tumors with low LRP1B showed upregulation of the EIF2 pathway while MTOR, RAB, and CDC42 pathways were enriched in MSI with low LRP1B. CDC42 and MTOR pathways were enriched in MSS tumors with low GRM3, and MSI with low GRM3 displayed enrichment of EIF2 and Notch pathways. In MSS tumors, both LRP1B and GRM3 were prognostic and associated with better survival (HR.66, 95% CI [.56-.78], p <.0001 for LRP1B; HR.79, 95% CI [.68-.92], p <.01 for GRM3) and high expression of either one was also associated with better prognosis for patients treated with Bev (HR.85, 95% CI [.70-.92], p <.01 for LRP1B; HR 0.88, 95% CI [.77-.99], p <.05 for GRM3). Conclusions: LRP1B and GRM3 appear to be important regulators in CRC because of their prognostic value and association with response to bevacizumab treatment. Both LRP1B and GRM3 are associated with pathways of cell cycle progression, cell migration, and DNA repair. A better understanding of their role in angiogenic signaling is critical to develop more effective strategies to improve response to bevacizumab or immunotherapy.',\n",

Post operative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can help detecting minimal residual disease in colon cancer after curative resection. Methods: The aim of this study was to identify the potential role of serum CEA after liver resection in patients with CLM. This study was conducted at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research from 2004 to 2018. Patients with CLM who underwent complete resection of primary tumors and liver metastases were enrolled in this study. We studied the associations between the perioperative CEA levels and characteristics of recurrence. Results: Recurrence was detected during the median follow-up time of 50.9 months in 343 (54.1%) of the total 633 patients analyzed. Patients with postoperative CEA (>5) group had a significantly higher recurrence rate (75.7% vs 50.0%, p < 0.01), with a shorter time until recurrence (4.4 months vs 36.9 months, p < 0.01) than those with a postoperative CEA level (≤5) group. In multivariate analysis, a postoperative CEA level >5 ng/ ml was an independent predictor, with the highest hazard ratio for both recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (RFS: 2.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.14–3.60, p <0.01, OS: 3.18, 95% CI 2.41–4.19, p <0.01). In addition, there was a significantly shorter RFS in the postoperative CEA level (>5) group who did not have normalized CEA levels after adjuvant chemotherapy compared to normalized CEA group (3.3 months vs 18.5 months, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The postoperative CEA and postadjuvant chemotherapy CEA level in the CEA level (>5) group after surgery may be a predictor of RFS and OS.',\n",

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 482 patients diagnosed with CC and underwent curative surgical resection at Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital. The inclusion criteria were: pathologically diagnosed with primary CC; stage I–III CC according to the 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system; and with available test results for KRAS mutation status. In total, 345 patients met these criteria and were included in this study. Results: Among the 345 patients, 140 (40.6%) exhibited KRAS mutations, with their incidences as follows: 90/140 (64.3%) in Exon 2 Codon 12, 37/140 (26.4%) in Exon 2 Codon 13, 1/140 (0.1%) in Exon 3 Codon 59, 7/140 (5.0%) in Exon 3 Codon 61, and 5/140 (3.6%) in Exon 4 Codon 146. KRAS mutation status was not a significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). Although, there were no significant differences in survival between patients with Exon 2 Codon 12 and Exon 2 Codon 13 mutations, poorer DFS (p = 0.085) and OS (p = 0.005) were seen in those with Exon 3 Codon 61 mutation than in others.

       "  '180Background: Medullary carcinoma (MC) of the colon was described first in 1999 and is characterized by undifferentiated sheets of epithelial cells in a solid growth pattern with pushing borders and prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. It frequently shows microsatellite instability (MSI). However, the clinicopathological and survival outcomes between MC and the more common adenocarcinoma of the colon (AC) are not well defined in a large database. Therefore, we used a large national registry to explore the association of survival characteristics with sociodemographic, geographic, and disease variables in this cohort of patients. Methods: We sampled the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for colon cancer patients diagnosed with MC from 2004-2018. Multivariate cox regression models were used to compare hazard ratios for demographic, geographic, and disease characteristics. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival plots were utilized to assess survival rate differences between MC and AC tumors located in the ascending, transverse, or descending colon. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Only 2,709 (0.29%) of the 922,667 patients with AC had MC. MC was seen in older patients than AC (76 vs. 69 years). MC was also more common in females than AC (72.5 vs. 49%). The most striking finding in our analysis was the predominance of poorly differentiated (63%) and undifferentiated (21.7%) pathologies in MC. This was in sharp contrast to AC, where 15.8% of patients were poorly differentiated, and only 2% were undifferentiated. Furthermore, undifferentiated and poorly differentiated MC tumors had a poor prognosis (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.26-1.68, p<0.001 and HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29-1.62, p<0.001 respectively) as compared to the other histological grades. Another notable finding in our analysis was the high prevalence of MSI in MC vs. AC (82.4% vs. 25.9%). Cecal MC (HR 1) had the worst prognosis of any colonic site. Left-sided MC tumors also had an inferior prognosis compared to AC (63.21 vs. 87.72 months), although not statistically significant (p=0.217). Conclusions: Colon cancer presenting as undifferentiated or poorly differentiated with associated MSI should raise the possibility of a medullary carcinoma diagnosis. However, given the rarity and difficulty in its pathological delineation, MC may remain underdiagnosed. In the modern treatment era, with the approval of immunotherapy for metastatic MSI colon cancer patients, survival and outcomes for metastatic MC may be improved.',\n",

       "  '181Background: Patients with microsatellite-instability–high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC) represent a unique subgroup of patients with evolving treatment opportunities. Methods: We included all of the patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of CRC at Hospital Universitario La Paz from October 2016 to September 2020. Results: A total of 1,152 patients were diagnosed with CRC. IHC for MMR was available in 1,014 patients. Of those, 100 (9,8%) patients were deficient for MLH1 and PSM2 (n = 78), MSH2 and MSH6 (n = 12), PMS2 (n =5), MSH6 (n = 4), or MSH2 (n = 1). Baseline characteristics are depicted in the table. Female sex (55% vs. 38%; p = 0,001), right primary tumor location (75% vs. 29%; p = 0,001), histological grade 3 (20% vs. 8%; p <0,001), and mucinous component (39% vs. 10%; p < 0,001), and localized disease at diagnosis (97% vs. 79% p < 0,001), were more frequent in dMMR group. Among patients with dMMR CRC, 53% were ≥75 years old. The prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation was 56%. More female sex (67% vs. 40%; p = 0,006) and BRAFV600E mutation (66% vs. 48%; p = 0,06) were found in older vs. younger dMMR patients. Six patients were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. After a median follow-up of 24 months, 279 patients have died. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached in either group (p = 0,327). Three-year OS was 75% (95% CI: 70-80) and 69 (95% CI: 67-71) in the dMMR and pMMR, respectively. In patients with localized disease that underwent antineoplastic treatment (n = 856), median disease-free survival (DFS) and OS were not reached in either group (p =0,403 and p = 0,232). Three-year DFS in patients with stage I (n = 216) was 64% (95% CI: 46-82) and 85% (95%CI: 80-90), p = 0,055; in patients with stage II (n = 274) was 84% (95% CI: 77-91) and 70% (95% CI: 66-74), p = 0,588; and in patients with stage III (n = 366) was 79 (95% CI: 71-87) and 66% (95% CI: 62-70%), p = 0,322; in dMMR and pMMR, respectively. No baseline characteristics were associated with recurrence in patients with localized dMMR CRC. Conclusions: Patients with MSI-High/dMMR CRC display distinctive clinical and pathological features. Overall prognosis does not differ in our series, but older age of dMMR patients may have influenced the outcomes.pMMR (n = 914)dMMR (n = 100)P valueSex (female)351 (38)55 (55)0,001Age70,672,10,001Primary tumor location\\u2003• Right colon\\u2003• Left colon\\u2003• Rectum• 267 (29)• 363 (39)• 284 (31)75 (75)19 (19)6 (6)0,001Stage\\u2003• I\\u2003• II\\u2003• III\\u2003• IV• 172 (18)• 230 (25)• 318 (34)• 194 (21)• 19 (19)• 41 (41)• 37 (37)• 3 (3)<0,001Lymphovascular invasion (n = 805)273 (37)27 (31)0,27Perineural invasion (n = 803)148 (20)11 (12)0,09Histological grade 3 (n = 856)61 (8)17 (20)<0,001Mucinous (n = 917)84 (10)35 (39)<0,001Budding (n = 567)\\u2003• Low\\u2003• Medium\\u2003• High• 263 (51)• 129 (25)• 116 (22)• 43 (72)• 12 (20)• 4 (6)0,003BRAF V600E mutation (n = 309)16 (6)41 (56)<0,001',\n",

       "  '182Background: Only few data on microsatellite instability in rectal cancer are available in literature, and dMMR role in pre-operative chemoradiotherapy response is under debate. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency and therapeutic implications of dMMR status in patients (pts) with locally advanced rectal cancer belonging to our Center. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from 231 patients belonging to the Medical Oncology Unit of the University Hospital of Cagliari from 2011 to 2021. All patients were affected by locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3-4 +/- N1-2). All patients included in the study underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment with capecitabine and RT long course (total dose of Gy 50.4) and subsequently underwent total mesorectal excision (TME) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Mismatch repair (MMR) expression was evaluated through immunohistochemistry on surgical samples. Results: Of the 231 patients, 213 were suitable for final analyzes. Patients median age was 68 years (range 34-89). 145/201 were male and 68 were female. 66 (31%) had stage II disease and 147 (69%) had stage III disease. Considering MMR, 205/213 (96%) patients had proficient mismatch repair (pMMR), while 8/213 (4%) had dMMR. In dMMR patients defective proteins were: MSH2 in 4 patients, MLH1 and PMS2 combined in 2 patients and MSH6 in 2 patient. dMMR patients showed, unlike pMMR patients, poor or no response to chemoradiotherapy. Responses were assessed through TRG evaluation (Ryan and Dworak scoring systems) on the primary tumour. 5 patients presented a TRG-3 and 3 patients showed a TRG-4, according to Ryan score. All of them had a grade 1 regression, according to Dworak. Conclusions: The results of our study, albeit with limitations related to the retrospective nature and the limited number of dMMR cases, might indicate a correlation between microsatellite instability and little or no response to preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. It would be useful to analyze the data prospectively and further evaluate MMR as a predictor of response to combined chemo-radiotherapy.Patients characteristics.pMMRdMMRN. of patients2058Stage II642Stage III1416Ryan score*1\\u2003TRG-186-\\u2003TRG-2110-\\u2003TRG-395\\u2003TRG-4-3\\u2003TRG-5--Dworak score*2\\u2003Grade 0--\\u2003Grade 198\\u2003Grade 2110-\\u2003Grade 374-\\u2003Grade 412-*1Ryan tumor regression (TRG) score: TRG-1 no visible cancer cells; TRG2 single cells or small group of cancer cells; TRG3 residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis; TRG4 significant fibrosis outgrown by cancer; TRG5 no fibrosis with extensive residual cancer.*2Dworak regression score: grade 0, no response; grade 1, minimal response; grade 2, moderate response; grade 3, near complete response; grade 4, complete response.',\n",

       "  '183Background: The identification of clinicopathological and molecular predictive and/or prognostic factors represents currently one the most challenging tasks in oncology. Significant efforts are currently being dedicated to identify patients who will or will not benefit from chemotherapy. In fact, drug resistance is a limiting factor of the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. However, despite modern surgical techniques and adjuvant systemic therapy, only 20% of patients with distant metastasis achieve long-term remission, while 60–70% of patients develop local or distant recurrence. Methods: Recently, we have identified by high-throughput approach that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), namely, miR-122-5p and miR-142-5p show a high potential for CRC screening and early detection as well as for the assessment of patients’ outcomes and the effectiveness of treatment schedule. Results: In detail, the expression levels of these miRNAs were significantly different between CRC patients and controls. A year after diagnosis, miRNA expression profiles were significantly modified in patients responding to treatment and were no longer different from those measured in controls. On the other hand, patients not responding to therapy maintained low expression levels in their second sampling. As selection during metastasizing may shift molecular patterns by which CRC liver metastases retain their unique molecular profile, we thus elaborated our results on CRC patients with liver metastasis and measured these circulating miRNAs repeatedly over two years. The first sampling was performed at the time of post therapy developed liver metastasis (i.e., recurrence), and every 3 months depending on patients` conditions (i.e., covering the liver resection, administration of chemotherapy etc). Detailed results of the study will be presented during the meeting. Conclusions: The present study aimed to explain why patients with the same cancer stage may differ in treatment susceptibility and long-term outcomes.',\n",

       "  '184Background: The immunoscore (IS), a prognostic score, was first validated in early colon cancer reflecting the immune response against the tumor. It showed potential in its ability to downstage patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) who would potentially benefit from organ-sparing therapies in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We first presented our initial outcome with 37.8% pCR in patients with LARC treated with short course radiation therapy (SCRT) followed by 6 cycles of mFOLFOX plus Avelumab followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) in the ESMO 23rd World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer 2021 Conference (presentation # SO-30). Here we are reporting the post-hoc analysis of the correlation between pCR and pre-treatment biopsy IS to further establish the IS as a prognostic score in patients with LARC. Methods: In this Phase II study, 44 patients were accrued from three centers, of whom 40 completed radiotherapy followed by chemoimmunotherapy then TME. 39 patients with available tissue samples, containing tumor cells and its margins, were collected at baseline. CD3 and CD8 cells were counted, and the IS is then derived from the mean density percentiles of CD3 and CD8 positive T cells infiltrating the tumor and in the invasive margin of the tumor. Cutoff for a high IS was established at 62%. We then compared the tumor regression grade (TRG) with the means of IS, using the student t-test. Results: 15 patients with pCR had a mean IS of 68 +/- 22 SD as opposed to a mean IS of 52 +/- 22 SD in 24 patients without pCR (p = 0.036). Conclusions: High IS correlates with TRG as pCR and successfully predicted clinical outcome in LARC patients who underwent chemoimmuno-therapy. It is a promising potential prognostic tool in stratifying patients who would benefit from specific modalities to augment pCR and subsequent organ preservation strategy.

       "  '185Background: The FOLFIRI regimen (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan) is a predominant treatment regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer. To optimize the benefit for the patients, it would be desirable to increase the efficacy of irinotecan by increasing the exposure of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) to the cancer cells, while maintaining a good safety profile. The oral drug SCO-101, that is currently being developed by Scandion Oncology A/S, was tested in an early clinical trial (CORIST-trial, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04247256). SCO-101 is an inhibitor of ABCG2, UGT1A1 and SRPK1. The CORIST trial was set up to address the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SCO-101 given orally for 6 days followed by FOLFIRI at varying doses from day 5 to 7, in a biweekly schedule, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have formerly been treated with FOLFIRI and afterwards progressed. The first part of the study was a dose-finding study, where the impact of SCO-101 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SN-38 was studied. Methods: 12 patients from the dose-finding part of the CORIST study received 150 mg SCO-101 for 6 days and 45 – 80% of the recommended dose of FOLFIRI. 6 of the patients had RAS wild-type tumors and these patients are the subject of the current analysis. Blood for PK analysis was sampled from the patients at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after treatment with FOLFIRI and SCO-101. The blood samples were analyzed for Cmax, T½ and AUC (0-24h) of SCO-101, irinotecan and SN-38. Results: The PK of SN-38 from the patients in the study, normalized to a dose of irinotecan of 90 mg/m2 showed a T½ day 5 of 19 hours (SD 5,7) a Cmax of 60 ng/ml (SD 20,6) and an AUC_0-24h of 1415 hxng/ml (SD: 670). The results were compared to SN-38 data from treatment with irinotecan at 180 mg/m2, which is used in standard doses of FOLFIRI and the data is presented in the table. The data analysis showed an increased T½, increased Cmax and increased AUC of SN-38 when combining SCO-101 with 90 mg/m2 irinotecan, compared to SN-38 PK data from standard irinotecan treatment of 180 mg/m2. The toxicity profile of the patients treated with 90 mg irinotecan/m2 (50% FOLFIRI) showed only grade 1 and 2 adverse events. Conclusions: SCO-101 in combination with FOLFIRI has demonstrated the ability to modulate the PK profile of SN-38 in mCRC patients with RAS wild-type tumors, by significantly increasing the half-life, the peak plasma concentration, and area under the curve of SN-38. The combined treatment was well tolerated, and the drug is now being tested for efficacy in the CORIST trial.Comparison of SN-38 PK data between standard irinotecan and data from CORIST study.Dose irinotecan/m2T½ hours (SD)Cmax ng/ml (SD)AUC_0-24 hxng/ml (SD)SN-38 Standard180 mg11,7 (4,3)40 (11,6)385 (115)SN-38 CORIST90 mg19 (5,7)60 (20,6)1415 (670)Fold increase (CORIST vs Standard)0,51,61,53,7',\n",

       "  '186Background: Distinct molecular subgroups of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been afforded with use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as standard in clinical practice for advanced disease. We have previously demonstrated that disease bulk predicts clinical resistance to EGFR inhibition in RAS/RAF-wildtype (WT) CRC. We hypothesized bulky disease would predict advanced subclonal heterogeneity by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in RAS/RAFWT CRC. Methods: Following IRB-approval, a retrospective review of molecular profiles in advanced CRC (n = 965) were compiled from the Veteran Administration’s (VA) National Precision Oncology Program (NPOP) and University of Wisconsin Precision Medicine Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). Disease bulk was defined as the longest diameter of metastatic disease or short axis for advanced lymphadenopathy. Molecular profiling was performed using commercially available platforms including Strata Oncology (MTB) and FoundationOne (NPOP). Bulky was compared as categorical (> 35 cm) and continuous variable against the count of pathologic variants. Results: The population was largely representative of advanced CRC with alterations in TP53 (80.5%), KRAS (44.8%), PIK3CA (22.0%) and BRAF (12.8%). Veterans had increased frequency of alterations in PIK3CA (22.7% v. 13.0%, p < 0.02) and BRAF (13.3% v. 6.9%, p < 0.05). There was no difference in metastatic bulk at the time of NGS for tissue biopsy between MTB and NPOP populations (t = 0.80). Disease bulk did not predict the number of pathologic variants from tissue sampling in RAS/RAFWT CRC (n = 96, t = 0.24). RAS/RAFMT cancers had increased frequency of subclonal alterations by ctDNA (9.1±4.0) v. RAS/RAFWT (4.5±3.4, p < 0.0001). Using ctDNA, bulky disease in RAS/RAFMT CRC was not predictive of increased pathologic variants (8.8±3.5 v. 9.5±4.8, t = 0.62). Bulky disease (> 35mm) in RAS/RAFWT CRC predicted increased subclonal variants (6.2±3.6 v. 3.5±2.9, p < 0.02). As a continuous variable, disease bulk predicted the number of pathologic variants in RAS/RAFWT CRC (R = 0.51). Conclusions: These data indicate that metastatic bulk is a predictor of subclonal heterogeneity by ctDNA in RAS/RAFWT CRC. Molecular profiling of tissue alone did not predict differences in subclonal heterogeneity when stratified by disease bulk in RAS/RAFWT CRC. Limited subclonal heterogeneity in non-bulky cancers support ongoing prospective investigations to select non-bulky cancers for early incorporation of anti-EGFR inhibition (NCT04587128).',\n",

       "  '187Background: Detection of MRD following metastatic liver resection in advanced CRC patients is associated with poor prognosis with high rate of relapse. Nevertheless, there is currently no standard of care to guide further therapy after curative intent surgery. MRD detection has the promise to be implemented into standard of care and guide treatment decision making. Here we establish feasibility of MRD detection using Foundation Medicine’s novel tissue-informed personalized monitoring assay, FoundationOne Tracker (F1T), in mCRC patients undergoing surgical resection with curative intent. Methods: Tissue-based CGP was performed retrospectively on a cohort of 72 patients from the PREDATOR trial. Trackable patient-specific single nucleotide variants were selected using a novel computational approach negating the need for buffy coat sequencing to filter germline variants. Personalized multiplex PCR was used to detect and evaluate prognostic value of ctDNA from plasma collected at MRD timepoint post-surgery (median 27 days, range 8-99.5). Median follow-up of patients in the overall population was 10.7 months (range: 0.9-53.8 months). Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier Estimator and Cox regression. Results: Post-surgical F1T analysis was successful on 96% of cases (69/72). CGP analysis revealed at least one driver mutation in 57% of samples (41/72) including KRAS/NRAS (46%) and BRAF mutations (3%). MRD was detected in 45% (31/69) of patients, of which 94% (29/31) had progressed at the time of the data cut. Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 3.2 months (2.1-7.1) in ctDNA-positive vs 28 months (20.9-NA) in ctDNA-negative population (HR 5, CI 2.7-9.3, p<0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 31.6 months in ctDNA-positive vs not reached in ctDNA-negative group (HR 27, CI 3.6-205, p<0.001). Conclusions: CGP-informed post-operative MRD detection is a strong prognostic biomarker and correlates with survival outcomes in patients with resected mCRC. F1T is a novel and convenient technological approach to MRD detection utilizing highly validated FMI testing to reveal potentially targetable mutations and inform personalized ctDNA monitoring. These results demonstrate the ability of F1T to accurately detect MRD in mCRC patients following surgical resection, without the need for germline sequencing.',\n",

       "  '188Background: Hepatic metastatic disease from colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant clinical problem, as the liver is the dominant metastatic site for patients with CRC and 25% of patients will have liver affection at diagnosis. Due to improvement in systemic therapy and locoregional treatments in the last decade, survival has increased significantly. In this regard, it is key to be able to establish several prognostic factors that significantly influence survival. Methods: We carried out a retrospective analysis of 554 patients with mCRC treated at the Gregorio Marañon Hospital (Madrid, Spain) between January 2010 and 2021. We analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients undergoing liver metastasis surgery as first metastasis surgery together with relapse patterns to progression. Results: Out of our cohort of 554 patients with mCRC we identified 169 patients that underwent liver metastasis surgery as 1st surgery, achieving a media of survival of 56.38 months [95% CI, 44.21-73.78 months]. Regarding the clinical characteristics of the population, the majority were men (63,91%) and had a PS 0-1 (90,5%); and 46 patients (27,2%) were more than 70 years old. In relation to the location of the primary tumour, 46 patients (27,2%) had it n the right colon and 120 in the left colon (71,0%). And 43 patients (25,4%) had extrahepatic disease at the time of surgery. Regarding the biomakers, we indentified the following mutations: 68 mutated KRAS (40,2%), 5 mutated NRAS (2,9%), 9 mutated BRAF (5,3%), 13 mutated PI3K (7,6%), 1 HER2 amplification (0,5%) and 4 with IMS phenotype (2,3%). After the metastasis surgery, progression was mainly hepatic (50,3%), followed by pulmonary (24,8%), peritoneal (11,8%), lymph node (12%), bones (4,7%) and cerebral (1,1%), without having significant differences in relapse patterns at the statistics when analyzed by genomic profile. When analyzing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) according to the genomic profile, in the BRAF mutated vs BRAF WT population, no statistically significant differences were found, obtaining therefore an evident benefit. Furthermore, we found significant differences in OS for patients with right vs left primary tumour as well as for patients with extrahepatic involvement at the time of surgery. Conclusions: Patients undergoing sequential metastatic surgery have a long survival, so it is important to analyse patterns of relapse and clinical course. There is no evidence of significant differences in the progression patterns according to the mutational status of the mCRC; but selected patients with BRAF mutations may obtain benefit in PFS and OS with locoregional approaches to their liver disease.',\n",

       "  '189Background: ctDNA is an attractive alternative to tissue for its easy accessibility and real time representation of systemic tumor profile. We explored the utility of ctDNA profiling during the course of mCRC treatment. Methods: Serial blood samples were obtained from mCRC patients before and during first-line palliative chemotherapy at fixed intervals (after every four cycles) until confirmed disease progression. ctDNA was sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform with 106 genes. Changes of ctDNA profile and treatment outcome were comprehensively analyzed. Results: A total of 272 samples from 62 patients were analyzed. In the pre-treatment blood samples, 56 (90.3%) of patients had detectable ctDNA mutations including single nucleotide variants, short insertions/deletions and copy number changes (median 4.5 mutations/ patient, range 0 - 133). In 31 (50.0%) patients who had tissue NGS panel results performed in the clinic, overall concordance between mutations from ctDNA and tissue was 86.5%. In three patients, ctDNA mutational profiles were found to be completely different from tissue profiles. At further investigation, these patients were found to have a separate primary cancer in their colon. At the time of the first follow-up, most (98.0%) patients showed decrease of ctDNA from baseline, represented by average variant allele frequency (VAF) changes of all ctDNA mutations found. Clearance of ctDNA was achieved in 40 (78.4%) patients and was associated with longer progression-free survival (median PFS 11.8 moths in ctDNA clearance (+) vs. 4.7 months in ctDNA clearance (-), p < 0.001). The ctDNA clearance at the same time point was able to further discriminate the patients in same category by RECIST 1.1. Serial follow-up monitoring revealed three patterns of ctDNA changes at the time of clinical progressive disease (PD): 1) re-emergence or re-increase of baseline ctDNA mutations, 2) emergence of new resistance mutations, 3) radiologic PD without evidence of ctDNA progression. In the patients with detectable ctDNA at PD, the ctDNA progression preceded radiologic progression in 25 (58.1%) patients by median of 3.3 months. The patients in clinical PD without ctDNA progression showed different patterns of metastasis having mainly extrahepatic spread, while 77.8% of the patients with ctDNA progression had their progression confirmed in liver metastasis. Diverse resistant mutations and gene amplifications in PD patients were discovered by ctDNA sequencing. For seven (16.3%) of the PD patients, the newly identified mutations could be potential candidates of targeted therapy or clinical trial. Conclusions: ctDNA profile provided additional information to conventional evaluation methods and reflected dynamic changes. ctDNA monitoring may improve precise treatment decision-making for individual patients.',\n",

       "  '190Background: Metastatic colorectal (CRC), pancreatic (PANC), and gastroesophageal (GE) cancers are the leading causes of GI cancer–related mortality (5-yr survival rate, 14%, 3% and ̃5-6%, respectively). T-cell immunotherapy targeting GI-associated tumor antigens has been attempted, but efficacy has been constrained by on-target off-tumor toxicity, limiting the therapeutic window. The Tmod (TM) platform is an AND-NOT logic-gated CAR T modular system, versions of which have a CEA- or MSLN-targeting CAR activator and a separate HLA-A*02-targeting blocker receptor to protect normal cells. Tmod CAR T exploits HLA LOH, common in GI malignancies (10-33% in primary solid tumors [TCGA]) and can kill tumor cells without harming healthy cells in\\xa0vitro and in\\xa0vivo. However, the prevalence of HLA LOH across GI tumors is unknown in the real-world setting. We utilized the Tempus xT oncology NGS database of patients with multiple GI tumors. From a standard-of-care NGS assay, GI cancer patients can be readily identified for HLA LOH and future treatment with Tmod CAR T therapy. Methods: The occurrence of HLA LOH in GI tumors of 1439 patients was assessed using paired germline and somatic DNA sequencing using a research assay [6]. CRC, PANC and GE patients with ≥ stage 3 were then extracted, and rates of HLA LOH were identified (ie, whether loss occurred across high-frequency HLA-A alleles). In addition, mutations in KRAS and BRAF, as well as MSI status were stratified to determine any association with HLA-A LOH. Results: HLA-A LOH was detected in 830 (17.3%) of all solid tumor records, and a similar proportion when all GI cancer records were analyzed (17.0%). For GI subtypes, these values ranged from 13.5% to 23.1% (Table). No high-frequency HLA-A allele (A*01, A*02, A*03, A*11) was more likely to be lost. Clinical biomarkers (KRAS, BRAF and MSI status) were not associated with HLA-LOH. Conclusions: The frequency of HLA LOH among advanced solid tumor cancers in this dataset is 17.3%, with a range of 13.5-23% between CRC, PANC and GE. The HLA LOH frequency observed in these GI tumors is consistent with that in primary tumors from TCGA, which also used germline-matched and tumor samples. Clinical biomarkers were not associated with HLA LOH. Tempus NGS was able to identify HLA LOH, which can be used for Tmod CAR T therapy to an enhanced therapeutic window. Identification of these patients in BASECAMP-1 (NCT04981119) will enable novel Tmod CAR T therapy.

       "  '191Background: Somatic alterations in KRAS and BRAF have prognostic as well as predictive impact in pts with mCRC; however, the differential impact of various somatic alterations in these genes need further characterization. We analyzed the prognostic impact of specific somatic mutations in KRAS and BRAF in mCRC pts. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of pts with mCRC at our institution who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) utilizing the Foundation One assay. Prevalence of genetic alterations was estimated using proportions and compared between groups using a chi-squared test. Patients were followed for survival from metastatic diagnosis until death or last follow-up, with left truncation at the time of CGP. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to estimate overall survival, and groups were compared using a Cox-regression based likelihood ratio test. Results: 192 pts were identified - median age at diagnosis was 55 years, 62% (119/192) presented with metachronous metastatic disease, and 28% (54/192) had a rectal primary. Somatic mutations in KRAS were found in 49% (95/192) pts, and 53% (50/95) had a left sided primary (p = 0.3). Majority of the KRAS mutations localized to codon 12 (72/95 -76%), KRAS G12C comprised 12% (11/95). Median Overall Survival (mOS) of KRAS mutated pts was 3.0 years compared to 3.5 years for KRAS wild type (WT) pts (p = 0.5). Median OS of pts with different KRAS mutations were as follows: codon 12 mutations (excluding G12C) - 2.7 years; KRAS G12C – 5.2 years; non-codon 12 KRAS mutations - 4.8 years. BRAF mutations were identified in 7.8% (15/192) pts, and 67% (10/15) had a right sided primary (p = 0.062). BRAF V600E represented the most common alteration in BRAF – 87% (13/15). Patients with BRAF mutation had a mOS of 1.8 years compared to 3.1 years for BRAF WT pts (p = 0.2). Median OS of pts with different BRAF mutations were as follows: BRAF V600E – 1.8 years and BRAF non V600E - 2.1 years (p = 0.4). Conclusions: The numerically higher mOS in pts with KRAS G12C and non-codon 12 KRAS mutations merit further biologic characterization with functional assays. Individualized therapeutic strategies must be conceptualized for mCRC pts with specific RAS/BRAF mutations, considering their widely disparate prognosis and putative downstream signaling mechanisms. Dynamic molecular simulation to understand conformational changes in proteins associated with specific mutations will be pivotal to optimizing precision therapeutic strategies.',\n",

       "  '192Background: Rectal cancer treatment paradigm has been evolving over time. Historically, for locally advanced rectal cancer, standard therapy (ST) consisted of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Recently, total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) approach that delivers both neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CAPOX or FOLFOX) and chemoradiation (or radiation only) prior to surgery is increasingly being utilized. The prognostic and predictive values of mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) in rectal cancer is not well characterized. Most dMMR patients receive the same treatment as MMR proficient (pMMR) patients although there is limited data that dMMR rectal cancer patients may not have the same level of benefits from neoadjuvant treatment. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the clinicopathological/molecular characteristics, disease response, and clinical outcomes in dMMR localized rectal cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of dMMR rectal cancer who were treated at Mayo Clinic between January 2000 to September 2021. Patients who presented with concurrent primary non-colorectal malignancies were excluded. The distributions of demographics, clinicopathological features, biomarkers, and outcome data were collected. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models were stratified by treatment arms to determine significance of treatment strategies. Results: Forty-one patients were identified with a median age of 45.3 years. Thirty (73.2%) pts were male. The most common MMR were loss of MSH2 and MSH6 (12/42; 29.3%) followed by loss of MLH1 and PMS2 (10/42; 24.4%) and solitary loss of MSH2 (4/42; 9.8%). The treatment, pathological response, and clinical outcomes are listed in table. With a median follow up of 101 months, only 6 patients (14.3%) died and median overall survival was not reached.

       "  '193Background: Enhanced understanding of the evolving clonal architecture under treatment stress is crucial to optimizing care and developing effective therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Emergence of genomic alterations (GAs) [mutations (muts) and amplifications (amps)] in RAS, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, and MET have been recognized as key resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR therapy in later lines in mCRC. Data regarding occurrence of these GAs under selective pressure in the first line setting is lacking. Methods: CALGB/SWOG 80405 was a randomized trial of bevacizumab (bev) vs cetuximab (cet) in first line mCRC. Patients (pts) with paired plasma samples (pre-treatment and post-progression) available for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing were included in this substudy. Sequencing of ctDNA was performed by Guardant360 assay in a CLIA-certified environment to detect GAs in 73 genes. RAS/BRAF status [mut vs. wild type (wt)] was based on clonal muts [pre-defined cutoff of relative MAF (rMAF) ≥ 25%] in ctDNA. Only samples with ≥1 GA were analyzed to minimize false negatives. The primary objective was to determine and compare prevalence of acquired GAs between study arms: bev (anti-VEGF) and cet (anti-EGFR). Descriptive statistics and Fisher’s exact test were used. Results: Baseline characteristics of ctDNA cohort were similar to the 80405 population. Among 133 randomized RAS/BRAF wt pts, 11 (15.3%) and 5 (8.2%) developed acquired GAs (OR 2.0, P = 0.29), in bev and cet arm, respectively. Key comparative data for pts with regard to acquired pathogenic GAs are shown in the table. Conclusions: In this randomized mCRC cohort, the ctDNA profile of acquired GAs with front line anti-EGFR chemotherapy appears to be strikingly distinct from that seen with later lines of therapy. Acquisition of GAs, classically associated with EGFR resistance in later line, was not only rare with upfront cet-chemotherapy but also comparable to bev-containing (anti-VEGF) regimen. The mechanisms of acquired resistance appear to differ when anti-EGFR therapy is administered in combination with highly active first line chemotherapy. Our findings have critical translational relevance to the timing and value of ctDNA-guided anti-EGFR rechallenge in mCRC pts, especially in those treated with anti-EGFR therapy upfront.Treatment ArmBev(N = 72)Cet(N = 61)PAny acquired mutations26 (36.1)20 (32.8)0.72Any acquired amplifications9 (12.5)5 (8.2)0.57Anti-EGFR Resistance GAs11 (15.3)5 (8.2)0.29Mutations9 (12.5)5 (8.2)0.57RAS4 (5.6)3 (4.9)0.99BRAF2 (2.8)2 (3.3)0.99EGFR4 (5.6)1 (1.6)0.37Amplifications3 (4.2)1 (1.6)0.62ERBB22 (2.8)1 (1.6)0.99MET1 (1.4)-0.99',\n",

       "  '194Background: Patients (pts) with multiple synchronous colon cancer primaries (MCPs) constitute a unique subset of pts with colon cancer. However, there are limited published studies about these pts. The objective of this study is to compare the characteristics and outcomes of pts with MCPs to those with single colon cancer primaries (SCPs) using the largest study population to date. Methods: Data was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015. Pts with synchronous MCPs were included and were matched 1:3 with pts with SCPs based on the Coarsened Exact Matching method for age, gender, and race. Only patients with multiple synchronous primaries were included (time since index = 0 months). We excluded pts with a lag time since diagnosis of index primary of 1 month or more. Univariate (UNA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses were performed to identify factors associated with patient outcomes. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between tumor/patient characteristics and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 3322 pts with MCPs and 9966 pts with SCPs were identified. Median age was 71 years. Majority were male (51.5%) and White (80.1%). 73.4% and 69.6% of pts had 12 or more lymph nodes examined for the MCPs and SCPs cohorts, respectively. The SCPs cohort included more T4 stage and more well- and moderately-differentiated histology. OS was significantly shorter in MCPs compared to SCPs (HR 1.29; 1.22-1.36; p < 0.001), with a 5- and 10-year OS rate of 47.8% and 28.2% for the MCPs and 56.4% and 41.6% for the SCPs, respectively, for all stages combined. In the MCPs cohort, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with an improved survival in AJCC stages II, III, and IV but not stage I. Conclusions: This is the largest study evaluating the impact of MCPs on outcomes. Across stages II to IV, pts with MCPs have a shorter survival than those with SCPs. Pts with stage II MCPs who receive adjuvant chemotherapy derive a survival benefit. Current guidelines do not list multiple synchronous primaries as a high-risk feature for stage II.',\n",

       "  '195Background: Currently, there are no guideline recommendations of anti-EGFR Ab specific to tumor sidedness in subsequent-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We previously reported the effect of primary tumor location on subsequent-line treatment with anti-EGFR Ab from a single center. Here we presented the outcome from a multi-center study. Methods: Medical records of patients diagnosed with mCRC at 3 academic centers in Thailand (Siriraj, Chulalongkorn, and Ramathibodi hospital) between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with KRASwt mCRC who received anti-EGFR Ab in second- or later-line treatment were included. The impact of tumor sidedness on progression-free survival (PFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier method, and those results were compared using log-rank test. Results: Among the 2,102 patients who had KRAS analysis data, 1,130 (54%) patients had KRASwt. Of those, 413 patients received anti-EGFR Ab in second- or later-line treatment. One hundred and sixty-two of 413 (39%) patients had extended RAS analysis. Seventy (17%) patients had right-sided tumors. Two hundred and thirty-eight (58%) patients received anti-EGFR Ab in the third line, and 132 (32%) patients and 43 (10%) patients were treated in the second and more than third line, respectively. Single-agent irinotecan was the most commonly used backbone chemotherapy (303/413, 73%). Patients with right-sided tumors had non-significantly inferior PFS compared to patients with left-sided tumors (median PFS: 5.7 months (mo), 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9-7.5 vs. 7.5 mo, 95% CI 6.5-8.5; p =0.17). Subgroup analysis showed no difference in PFS when stratified by treatment lines. Patient with right-sided tumors had significantly inferior OS compared to patients with left-sided tumors (median OS: 23.3 mo vs. 29.9 mo; p =0.005). Conclusions: To date, this is the largest real world data of the effect of primary tumor location on anti-EGFR Ab which demonstrated that tumor sidedness has no significant impact on treatment outcomes in KRASwt mCRC patients receiving second- or later-line therapy. Our findings do not support the utility of tumor sidedness for treatment selection in these settings. We confirmed that patients with right-sided tumors had significantly worse survival.',\n",

       "  '196Background: The ESMO clinical practice guidelines recommend consideration of Immunoscore (IS) for risk assessment of early colon cancer patients. IS clinical performance was assessed in the SCOT and IDEA-HORG trials evaluating 3 vs. 6 months (3m vs. 6m) of mFOLFOX6 adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: 1,002 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples (762 from SCOT;240 from HORG) were collected, of which 851 were eligible for biomarker analysis. Eligible samples were classified into 2 groups using pre-defined cut-offs (IS-Low, IS- High) and the performance of IS to predict 3 year disease-free survival (3y-DFS) was evaluated. Results: IS was successfully assessed in 846 cases (99%). 615 (72.7%) samples were classified as IS-High (311 and 304 in 3m and 6m arm, respectively). No significant association between IS and patients’ gender, age, PS, BMI or primary tumour location was observed. However, a significant difference between IS-High (43.7%) and IS Low (57.1%) was observed in the proportion of high risk (T4 and/or N2) tumours (p=0.001). Patients with IS-High tumors had significantly longer 3y-DFS (79.4%, 95%CI: 75.9%-82.4%) compared to those with IS-Low tumors (65.0%, 95%CI: 58.3%-70.9%); adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.9 (95%CI: 1.46-2.46; p<0.0001). Similarly, IS-High was significantly correlated with longer 3y-DFS in both treatment arms: 78.5% (95% CI 73.4%-82.7%) for IS-High and 65.8% (95% CI 56.1%-73.9%) for IS-Low in 3m arm; 80.3% (95% CI 75.3%-84.5%) for IS-High and 64.4% (95% CI 54.8%-72.6%) for IS-Low in 6m arm. The estimated HRs according to treatment duration and IS classification were 1.80 (95% CI 1.25-2.60) in 3m arm, 2.00 (95% CI 1.38-2.92) in 6m arm and 1.89 (95% CI 1.46-2.47) in the total study population; interaction p = 0.687. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm the prognostic value of IS observed in the IDEA-France trial (Pagès F et\\xa0al 2020). However, this analysis was not powered to determine the predictive value of IS for treatment duration. Similar analysis of patients treated with CAPOX is warranted.',\n",

       "  '197Background: Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed cell death, is one of the anti-tumor mechanisms of anti-angiogenesis drugs. RAS mutation can confer ferroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous studies suggested that polymorphisms of ferroptosis regulator genes are associated with the increased risk of CRC. Therefore, we hypothesized that genetic variants in the ferroptosis regulator genes may predict first-line treatment outcome in RAS-mutant mCRC pts treated with bevacizumab (bev)-based chemotherapy. Methods: Genomic DNA from blood samples of mCRC pts enrolled in two independent randomized trials, MAVERICC (FOLFIRI+bev arm: discovery cohort, RAS-mutant, n = 56; control-1: RAS-wildtype, n = 87) and TRIBE (FOLFOXIRI+bev arm: validation cohort, RAS-mutant, n = 57; control-2: RAS-wildtype, n = 34), was genotyped through the OncoArray, a customized array manufactured by Illumina including approximately 530K SNP markers. The impact on outcome of 13 selected SNPs in 5 main ferroptosis regulator genes (ACSL4, LPCAT3, SLC3A2, SLC7A11, ALOX15) was analyzed. Results: In the MAVERICC bev cohort, pts with RAS-mutant tumors carrying ALOX15 rs7217186 any C allele (n = 35) showed significant longer overall survival (OS) than carrier of T/T allele (n = 5) in both univariate (24.97 vs. 12.22 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.9; p = 0.02) and multivariate (HR = 0.06; 95%CI 0.007-0.5; p = 0.009) analysis. In the TRIBE bev cohort, RAS-mutant carriers of any C allele (n = 30) showed numerically longer progression-free survival (PFS), compared to carriers of T/T allele (n = 13) in both univariate (11.91 vs. 9.47 months, HR = 0.45; 95%CI 0.2-1.02; p = 0.05) and multivariate (HR = 0.42; 95%CI 0.16-1.1; p = 0.09) analysis. Conversely, RAS-wildtype carriers of any C allele (n = 17) showed significant shorter PFS than T/T carriers in the TRIBE bev cohort (8.91 vs. 15.59 months, univariate HR = 3.39, 95%CI: 1.03-11.18, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that ALOX15 polymorphisms may have different predictive values for the bev-based treatment in mCRC patients based on RAS mutational status. These findings may provide novel insights for the combination of ferroptosis inducers and anti-VEGF treatment.',\n",

       "  '198Background: Rising incidence in early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is a recent phenomenon observed especially in the US. We exploited Sarah Cannon’s web-based analytics platform, to compare the genomic profiles of EO-CRC to late-onset colorectal cancer (LO-CRC). Methods: Commercial NGS testing performed in oncology practices are routinely extracted and harmonized into the Genospace database. Data from CRC adenocarcinomas were selected; patients (pts) with unknown microsatellite instability (MSI) status were excluded. To reduce the confounding effect of MSI-high hypermutated tumors, only MSI-stable (MSS) tumors were analyzed. Reports generated from archival tissue samples were analyzed separately from those generated from plasma, since liquid biopsies were more likely to be post-treatment. Results: NGS reports from 1,477 MSS CRC pts were analysed. Compared to LO, EO pts had same sex distribution and significantly lower prevalence of Caucasian ethnicity (53% LO vs. 43% EO, p < 0.01). 1029 were tissue (18.7% EO) and 448 plasma (17.8% EO) tests. Of 68 CRC-related genes assessed in tissue, 2 were significantly enriched in EO: BRCA1 mutation (3% LO vs. 7.3% EO p 0.01); PTEN mutation (3% LO vs. 6.2% EO p 0.05). Looking at panel-wide gene association, 19 genes (tissue) were enriched in EO, though none were significant after multiple testing correction. In plasma, ATM alterations were significantly higher in LO (17.3% LO vs. 3.8% EO p <0.001, FDR 0.16), (likely clonal haematopoiesis). No difference in tissue nor plasma TMB were observed [tissue: median (IQ): LO 5.04 (3.5 - 7); EO 4.39 (2.5 – 6.1); TMB >10: 7% LO vs. 6% EO; plasma: median (IQ): LO 8.73 (5.7 – 13.4); EO 7.19 (2.9 – 12.6); TMB >10: 12% LO vs. 14% EO]. Overall, tissue and plasma genomic profiles were concordant, except for EGFR alterations (4.5% tissue, 21.6% plasma, possibly acquired amplification post-EGFR therapy). Conclusions: Here we provide real-world insight from pts across the US. In MSS CRC, tissue and plasma genomic profiles of EO pts do not significantly differ from LO pts. Epigenetic and transcriptional events should be investigated. Enrichment for BRCA1 and PTEN mutations in EO pts may have important screening and therapeutic implications; germline status will be further investigated.',\n",

       "  '199Background: The encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet) regimen showed survival benefit and a higher response rate over standard chemotherapy among pretreated patients (pts) with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the phase III BEACON trial. Herein, we report the safety and efficacy of the triplet regimen in a prospective study (JapicCTI-205146) as a Japanese expanded access program (EAP). Methods: The key eligibility criteria were age ≥18 years and a diagnosis of BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC with progression observed after one or two prior systemic chemotherapy. Encorafenib (300 mg QD), binimetinib (45 mg BID), and weekly cetuximab (400 mg/m2, followed by 250 mg/m2) were administered. Patients who had received at least one dose of any study drug were included in this analysis. Adverse events were evaluated using CTCAE v4.0. The objective response rate (ORR) was evaluated using RECIST Guideline Version 1.1. Results: A total of 86 pts were enrolled from 10 Japanese institutions from February to December 2020. Safety and efficacy were evaluated in 81 pts. The median age was 60 years. Fifty-four pts (67%) had ECOG PS 0 and 50 pts (62%) received one prior chemotherapy. Treatment-related serious adverse events and grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were observed in 14 (17%) and 24 (30%) pts, respectively. Treatment-related death occurred in one pts. Among the 76 pts with target lesions, 21 pts were responders, and the confirmed ORR was 27.6%. Stable disease was observed in 42 pts, resulting in a disease control rate of 82.9%. The ORR was consistent regardless of ECOG PS status, the number of prior chemotherapy lines, and the number of metastatic organs. Conclusions: The safety and efficacy of the triplet regimen in the Japanese EAP were comparable to those in the BEACON trial. These results support the triplet regimen as a new standard-of-care treatment option in the second- or third-line treatment of pts with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC in the Japanese population, as there was a promising response without any new safety signals.

       "  '200Background: Signatera (S) assay is a CLIA certified minimal residual disease ctDNA assay that has become widely used for monitoring of disease relapse in patients (pts) with resected colorectal cancer. In a longitudinal study, S+ recurrence (SR) occurred at median > 10 months (mo) prior to radiographic disease recurrence (RDR) in a prospective clinical trial. However, the radiographic surveillance frequency in that study was inadequate by US standard practices. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated, in a single center, the sensitivity (ss), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of S, CT/MRI imaging (Im), and CEA in curatively resected stage II, III, IV pts against True Disease Recurrence (TDR). We considered TDR as any SR, RDR confirmed by pathology, RDR associated with CEA elevation, or RDR with sequential growth on imaging or regression with chemo. S and CEA were performed Q3 mo x 2 yrs and then Q6 mo x 3 yrs. Im was performed Q3 mo x 2 yrs and then Q6 mo x 3 yrs in resected stage IV, Q6 mo x 2 yrs and then Q yr x 3 in stage III/high-risk stage II, and Q yr x 5 yrs in low-risk stage II. Results: 48 pts underwent curative resection (31 stage II-III, 17 stage IV). 15 patients recurred during surveillance (6 stage II-III, 9 stage IV). The ss, sp, ppv, and npv of S, Im, CEA, and (Im and/or CEA) are tabulated below. S, Im, CEA, and Im or CEA were positive for recurrence at the diagnosis of TDR in 8, 9, 4, and 12, respectively. S sensitivity was poor for lung recurrence with 5/6 pts with lung-only mets (3 confirmed by path) being negative by S at the time of Im relapse. S was negative at the time of CNS recurrence and liver recurrence in 2 pts. 2 Pts with negative imaging at SR developed subsequent liver metastases. 2 Pts, counted as TDR, were SR and remain NED without any therapy, by CEA and Im > 1.5 years from S positivity. Conclusions: S does not appear to provide definitive advantages as a surveillance strategy over standard Im frequency- when performed as per NCCN guidelines. Sensitivity of S is particularly poor for low volume lung-only disease recurrence.StageS %Im %CEA %Im or CEA %II-IIIIVII-IVII-IIIIVII-IVII-IIIIVII-IVII-IIIIVII-IVss66.744.453.333.377.8%605011.126.783.377.880sp1001001009610096.98810090.98410087.8ppv10010010066.7100905010057.155.610075npv92.661.582.585.78084.2885073.295.58090.6',\n",

       "  '201Background: Dostarlimab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody that is approved in the US as a monotherapy in adult patients (pts) with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed on or following prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen or dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Here, we report on the antitumor activity and safety of dostarlimab monotherapy in pts with dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC), a post-hoc subgroup analysis of cohort F of the GARNET trial. Methods: GARNET is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of dostarlimab monotherapy in pts with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. Cohort F of the GARNET expansion cohorts enrolled pts with dMMR/MSI-H or POLε mutated non-endometrial solid tumors, including pts with CRC. Pts must have progressed per blinded independent central review (BICR) following prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Pts with CRC were required to have progressive disease after or been intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Pts received 500 mg intravenous dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by 1000 mg every 6 weeks until discontinuation. Primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response by BICR per RECIST v1.1. Pts were included in the efficacy analysis if they received ≥1 dose of dostarlimab, had measurable disease at baseline, and had ≥24 weeks of follow-up. All pts who received ≥1 dose of dostarlimab were included in the safety analysis. Results: As of the March 01, 2020 interim analysis data cut, 141 pts with dMMR non-endometrial solid tumors were included in the safety analysis, with 106 in the efficacy analysis. Of the pts in the efficacy analysis, 69 (65.1%) had CRC. Confirmed ORR by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in pts with dMMR CRC was 36.2% (95% CI, 25.0%–48.7%). There were 3 complete responses and 22 partial responses. At the data cut, 23 pts (92%) were still on treatment. Median duration of response had not been reached for pts with CRC. In the overall dMMR non-endometrial solid tumor population, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 68.1% of pts, with 8.5% of pts experiencing at least 1 grade ≥3 TRAE. The most common grade ≥3 TRAE was lipase increased in 2 (1.4%) of pts. Only 5 pts (3.5%) discontinued dostarlimab due to at TRAE. Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 9 (6.4%) pts. Conclusions: Dostarlimab demonstrated durable clinically meaningful antitumor activity in pts with dMMR CRC, which was consistent with that seen in patients with dMMR non-CRC solid tumors. No new safety signals were detected in patients with dMMR non-endometrial solid tumors. Clinical trial information: NCT02715284.',\n",

       "  '202Background: The optimal treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after the second line is still controversial. Regorafenib (Reg) revealed promising results by improving overall survival compared to best supportive care. However, in real-world practice rechallenge chemotherapy (CTr) is often preferred even though supporting evidence is not enough. We aim to compare the efficacy of regorafenib and 5-fluorouracil-based (5-FU) rechallenge treatment in the third line setting of mCRC. Methods: In this retrospective multi-institutional trial, mCRC patients from 21 centers in Turkey progressing after 2 lines of chemotherapy between 2012-2020 were analyzed. Patients who were treated with Reg or rechallenge therapy in the third-line setting were eligible. Rechallenge chemotherapy was identified as the re-use of the 5-FU based regimen which was administered in one of the previous treatment lines. Overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and toxicity were analyzed. Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used for analysis. Results: The clinical data of 441 mCRC patients were analyzed. Of these, 284 received regorafenib while 156 received rechallenge chemotherapy. The mean age was 57 and 56% was male. Median OS since the diagnosis was better with CTr than with Reg (48 months (95% CI, 43.4–52.6) vs. 39 months (95% CI, 35.4–42.5), p<0.001). Median OS after the third-line treatment was 12.0 (95% CI, 9.9–14) and 9.0 months (95% CI, 7.5–10.4) for CTr and Reg groups, respectively (p<0.001). PFS was 6 months for patients receiving CTr and 4 months for those treated with Reg (p = 0.139). ORR was significantly higher in CTr group than Reg (p<0.001). BRAF status, MSI status and treatment type (CTr vs. Reg) are factors found associated with OS in Cox regression analysis (p<0.001, p=0.021 and p<0.001, respectively). Adverse effects were seen in 82% and 68.2% of patients receiving Reg and CTr, respectively. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects was higher in patients treated with Reg (10% vs. 2.5%). Conclusions: Our analysis revealed that rechallenge is an appreciated option, in both efficacy and toxicity, when the limited treatment options for mCRC is considered. Although regorafenib treatment contributes to survival, CTr shows better disease control. Our study has the highest number of patients in the literature. Still, prospective studies are mandatory for validation of CTr in the third-line treatment of mCRC.',\n",

       "  '203Background: Anti-EGFR treatment of RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Latin America includes cetuximab or panitumumab, added to chemotherapy (cet+CT and pan+CT, respectively). Adverse event (AE) profiles for each regimen may influence the treatment decision. This study aimed to estimate the associated financial impact of AE management in three countries: Argentina (AR), Brazil (BR) and Panama (PA) from a healthcare payer perspective. Methods: We revised a published Microsoft Excel-based economic model to calculate average patient- and population-level costs from a payer perspective of mCRC AE management for first-line cet+CT and pan+CT treatment, using AE frequency and severity data derived from the authorization relevant FDA prescribing information (PI), multiplied by the country-specific unit costs of managing AEs. Costs of AE management were obtained from publicly available sources in each country and converted to US dollars (USD). Country-specific market research data were applied to calculate costs at the eligible mCRC population level. The model structure and input parameters were endorsed by local practising oncologists. Results: A 17.5% (all-grade) and 31.6% (grade 3-4) lower average per patient AE frequency were estimated from the PI, for cet+CT vs pan+CT. Cost results are presented in the table. Projected AE management costs of cet+CT for the eligible mCRC population are $297,643 (AR), $124,981 (BR) and $65,895 (PA), annually, reducing current annual estimated AE costs by $42,181 (AR), $8,548 (BR) and $4,691 (PA). Conclusions: According to the average estimated AE frequencies, patients treated with cet+CT are expected to experience fewer AEs than with pan+CT. According to our analyses, the lower frequency rates could result in lower overall and severe AEs’ management costs, resulting in 12.4% (AR), 6.4% (BR) and 6.6% (PA) lower costs of AE management for cet+CT versus pan+CT.Results.CountryPer patient cost estimate (USD)Estimated eligible mCRC patients per yearmCRC population AE management cost (USD)Cet+CTPan+CTCet+CTPan+CTCet+CTPan+CTAR311389411545127,962211,862BR16919438435465,03168,499PA709876652846,05624,531',\n",

       "  '204Background: In Peru, colon cancer is the 5th most common cause of cancer and the sixth most deadly. Currently, surgery remains as the only curative therapy, however, there is risk of recurrence. Adjuvant chemotherapy has become a useful tool to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In this study, we determine the current survival of our stage III colon cancer patients, submitted to adjuvant chemotherapy, and if this is similar to the evidence seen in large international studies; also, we analyze if delay of adjuvant chemotherapy has impact on survival. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study involved 162 patients with stage III colon cancer who underwent a resection surgery and received adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. They were evaluated, according to the TNM classification (tumor, nodule), as low risk (T1-T3, N1) and high risk (T4, N2). We also classified patients, according to the weeks of delay from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy, into subgroups of 6, 8 and 10 weeks. Results: The mean age was 63.7 years, 63 patients were women (38.9%), 99 patients (61.1%) were men. Only 38.3% of patients started adjuvant chemotherapy in the first 6 weeks after surgery, and 85.8% of patients, in the first 10 weeks; the median time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy was 7.0 weeks. We estimated that, at 3 years, the median PFS is 73.5% (95% CI: 65.8-82.1). The 3-year PFS in the low-risk group was 82.9% (95% CI: 72.3-95.0) and 67.3% (95% CI: 57.2-79.2) in the high-risk group. It was estimated that at 3 years, the median OS is 81.1% (95% CI: 75.2-87.5). The 3-year OS in the low-risk group was 87.9% (95% CI: 80.4-96.2) and 76.0% (95% CI: 67.8-85.3) in the high-risk group. Conclusions: The PFS and OS in Peruvian population is similar to data evidenced in international historical studies such as the IDEA trial. This study, also, suggests that starting adjuvant treatment within 10 weeks does not present an impact on OS and PFS in our population.',\n",

       "  '205Background: PALTOWN’s Facebook community, COLONTOWN, serves over 6,000 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and caregivers. 81% of members are late stage patients (or late stage caregivers), and 85% are under the age of 60. They are highly motivated to find reliable information about treatment options as quickly as possible. Many arrive with little prior CRC education. Here we illustrate the creation of a patient-centric disease education program, COLONTOWN University (CTU), developed from the conversations and information journeys in COLONTOWN. Methods: CTU is a unique model for disseminating patient-facing disease education. CTU’s patient and caregiver staff develop original resources from a patient perspective, and work with principal investigators, testing companies, and other partners to create content specifically designed for the Learning Centers. Each Center provides resources to address the information needs of patients across both the spectrum of disease education and of CRC disease experience. Within the University’s online platform, self-contained Learning Centers offer structured resource libraries on topics of high interest to patients. Results: CTU creates patient-centric disease education that is accessible and more sophisticated than typical patient education materials. The discussions in COLONTOWN, in groups focused on specific biomarkers, metastases locations, and treatment modalities, provide members with the framework for understanding their disease. CTU gives them the resources they need to have informed discussions with their care teams. The CTU platform provides insight into what resources are most utilized. Survey tools facilitate an understanding of whether patients feel they have access to more treatment options, and have more productive interactions with their care teams, as a result of the education provided by CTU and the conversations with their peers in COLONTOWN. Conclusions: In its first year, CTU has become the education resource of choice for the thousands of members of COLONTOWN. Clinicians, principal investigators, and industry have all been enthusiastic partners in the development of resources. The positive response to CTU demonstrates the value of this model of patient-driven disease education.Learning CenterFocusScopeCRC 101What do newly diagnosed late-stage patients need to know?Understanding diagnosis and first line treatment optionsDiagnostic and Surveillance TestsWhat are current biomarker testing options for CRC?Role of biomarkers in treatment, new testing optionsClinical Trials BasicsHow to navigate the clinical trials ecosystemUnderstanding clinical trials, and identifying trial options to discuss with care teamPrecision MedicineHow is precision medicine used in CRCUnderstanding precision medicine and its current application in CRCThe Lecture HallCRC education directly from clinicians and researchersVideo library from immunotherapy to liver transplants',\n",

       "  '206Background: Human serum metabolome profiles have been analyzed to explore the molecular changes that occur with aging. We hypothesized that deep metabolic profiling of sera with different ages would allow the identification of distinct metabolic chronologic patterns as a normal biological baseline to study personal aging. We further hypothesized that metabolic assessment of this chronologic deviation, resulting from advanced precancerous lesion (APL) and stage I/II/III CRC, from the normal reference baseline, would be instrumental for prognosis of relapse revealing underlying pathophysiology. Methods: A cohort of normal (n=3,616, training; n=1,170, testing), 631 advanced adenoma, 1,019 stage I, 404 stage II and 417 stage III serum samples were assembled. Innovative global LCMS metabolomic production were applied to deep profile these subjects. Identification of the age-associated molecular patterns in normal subjects, modeled with an elastic net\\xa0algorithm, established the reference baseline to mirror a metabolic clock. CRC associated deviation from the precise chronologically paced metabolic patterns was quantified to associate the clinical endpoints of relapse, OSF and PFS, and to identify the tightly associated metabolic pathways. Results: We observed that for those CRCs, the predicted metabolic age can differ from the chronological age with consistent variations, resulting “older” or “younger” metabolic age subgroup in reference to the chronological age. Significant disruptions from the normal baseline were observed in CRCs patients, and consistent stage specific patterns were observed. Outlier, “Older” or “younger” metabolic age subgroup, CRC patients were found with significant future relapse enrichment. Predictive models were derived to case find the patients at risk of future relapse at the CRC diagnosis timepoint. Conclusions: Deviations from the meticulously timed metabolic aging patterns may provide utility to allow prognosis of future clinical endpoints of relapse and overall survival. Close examination of the underlying metabolic pathways, associated with CRC stage specific metabolic patterns, disrupting the baseline ageotypes, not only may improve the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic tests of CRC relapse, but also shed new insights into CRC therapeutics.',\n",

Predicting or recognizing early symptoms of HFSR could allow for better care. Digital solutions for ambulatory monitoring of patients provide an opportunity for monitoring and early detection of HFSR in home conditions. Methods: FACET is a phase 4, prospective, open-label, multicenter, interventional trial designed to assess the clinical utility, technical feasibility and usability of a system including a camera, FeetMe Connected insoles for gait assessment, ePRO questionnaires (HFS-14, EQ-5D-5L, FAS and VAS), and educational materials to detect and grade the severity of HFSR. During the study, enrolled patients developing an HFSR will be assigned to the HFSR group and patients without any sign of HFSR, they will be assigned to non-HFSR group. Study registration number at ANSM (French Authority): ID-RCB 2020-A03080-39. Patients will have metastatic colorectal cancer requiring initiation of regorafenib in accordance with clinical practice standard. Other key inclusion criteria are ECOG Performance Status 0-2, ability to understand the instructions and complete the ePRO questionnaires, ability to understand and communicate in French language, familiarity in using mobile communication devices and mobile application software, no previous episode of HFSR or HFS. The primary objective is to explore fit-for-purpose, and usability of the ePRO instruments and the data collecting devices. The primary endpoint is participants’ compliance with data collection measured by ePRO questionnaires completion, use of camera to take images vs expected and number of device days of insoles usage vs expected. Secondary objectives are to characterize variables exhibiting significant associations with development of HFSR. Secondary endpoints include summary statistics of ePRO questionnaires scores at the HFSR worst grade event in the HFSR group vs at 3 weeks in the non-HFSR group; Summary statistics for Feetme Connected insoles variables; Regorafenib dose modifications and treatment discontinuation; Participant’s device daily use to generate data; Participants ability to reach a hotline for technical issues or usability complaints. For HFSR related secondary endpoints, a blinded and independent Preliminary Adjudication Committee (PAC) will retrospectively assign participants to two groups (HFSR vs. no-HFSR) based on a case-by-case blinded assessment. An independent Final Adjudication Committee will compare the PAC assessment and investigators’ assessments done on site. It is planned to include a total of 38 participants from 4 centers.

       "  'TPS208Background: The USPSTF recently recommended colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for adults aged 45 to 49 years in addition to those aged 50 to 75 years. This guideline update, which increases the number of screen-eligible individuals by ̃19 million, is similar to the recommendation in 2018 by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and is based on the modeling studies that reflect rising CRC incidence rates in younger adults. Currently, only 67% of average-risk individuals over the age of 50 years are up-to-date on CRC screening, and adherence to screening is lower in younger individuals (e.g., 50-54 years). Despite the non-invasive nature of existing stool-based CRC tests, barriers remain to adoption, including a dislike for manipulating stool and a requirement for substantial navigational support. Blood tests may overcome these barriers through ease of sample collection and integration into routine blood work. Methods: Here we describe our prospective, multi-center registrational study for validating a blood-based multiomics test for average-risk CRC screening: PREEMPT CRC. Eligible participants include those aged 45-85 with no known history of CRC or colorectal adenomas who are undergoing CRC screening by colonoscopy. The target enrollment is 25,000 participants, and primary outcome measures are sensitivity for CRC and specificity for advanced colorectal neoplasia, which includes CRC and advanced adenomas. Secondary outcome measures include positive predictive value for CRC, negative predictive value for advanced colorectal neoplasia, and sensitivity for advanced adenomas. Novel recruitment methods have been implemented by combining traditional, site-based recruitment and virtual recruitment using an online web portal, coupled with mobile phlebotomy, to make participation broadly accessible, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants have been enrolled from 40 states as of August 2021, and virtual recruitment has enabled widespread participation, potentially from any zip code in the continental US. To ensure adequate representation of the intended use population, community organizations, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), and universities have been engaged to reach underserved and minority patient populations. The study was initiated in May 2020 and to our knowledge will be the largest prospective, multi-center registrational validation study of an average-risk CRC screening test to date.

       "  'TPS209Background: Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome and is responsible for about 3% of newly diagnosed CRC. It is caused by germline mutations in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and patients with LS carry a lifetime risk of CRC ranging between 10% and 70%. The role of inflammation in driving this malignant transformation is now well established and retrospective studies have revealed a potential chemo-preventative role for omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), possibly via inhibition of inflammatory pathways associated with the development of defective MMR CRC tumors. While patients with LS have the highest risk of developing CRC, the majority of chemoprevention trials are focused on sporadic CRC. Effective interventions to reduce the risk of developing CRC in this population are limited to close surveillance and surgical prophylaxis. There is an unmet need for safe, effective, and non-invasive chemo-preventive interventions in patients with LS. Methods: This pilot study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial of omega-3 acid ethyl esters (generic Lovasa; 2 grams orally once daily) for adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with confirmed LS (based on germline testing of the MMR genes panel: MLH1, MSH2, MSHS6, PMS2 or deletion in EPCAM gene). Patients who are not candidate for elective endoscopy and/or with prior history of right sided or pan-colectomy are excluded. Thirty-four patients are expected to enroll, with a primary objective to determine the feasibility (defined as 80% retention rate) of 12 months of treatment with 2 grams capsules of omega-3 acid ethyl esters daily. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability of the intervention. Correlative aims include pre and post treatment assessment of colon mucosal tissue proliferation (right sided colon specimens will be evaluated for markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (Caspase-3)), the effect of omega-3 acid ethyl esters on inflammatory markers in serum, urine and feces (PGE-2, COX-2, β-catenin levels, and EPA:AA ratios), and gene expression related to proliferation, apoptosis and cell survival in colon tissue (NF-κB/Wnt pathways). The impact of omega-3 acid ethyl esters on intestinal microbiota will also be assessed (16S rRNA-based profiling). Correlative Colon tissue, serum, urine and feces samples are collected at baseline and at 12 months. The study is actively enrolling with 20 patients enrolled at the time of submission.

       "  'TPS211Background: Approximately 10% of patients (pts) with mCRC have BRAF mutations (mostly V600E). First-line tx options for BRAFV600E mCRC are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy ± anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR; or immune checkpoint inhibitors in pts with MSI-H tumors. In Europe, Japan, and USA, the combination of BRAF inhibitor enco + EGFR inhibitor cet is approved for tx of BRAFV600E mCRC after prior therapy. In BEACON CRC, enco + cet resulted in a median overall survival (OS) of 9.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0–11.3) and an objective response rate (ORR) of 19.5% (95% CI: 14.5%–25.4%) in previously treated pts with BRAFV600E mCRC (median follow-up: 12.8 months); 57.4% of pts had grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs), and 9% discontinued due to AEs. Given the poor prognosis of pts with BRAFV600E mCRC and based on the efficacy and tolerability of enco + cet from BEACON CRC, the BREAKWATER study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of enco + cet ± chemotherapy in tx-naive pts with BRAFV600E mCRC. Methods: BREAKWATER is an open-label, global, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 study with a safety lead-in (SLI). Approximately 60 and 870 pts will be enrolled in the SLI and phase 3 parts of the study, respectively. Pts must have mCRC with BRAF V600E-mutation (determined using tumor tissue or blood); ECOG performance status 0/1; and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. Pts in the SLI must have evaluable disease (RECIST v1.1) and have received ≤ 1 prior tx regimen; those previously treated with a BRAF or EGFR inhibitor, or both oxaliplatin and irinotecan, will be excluded.

       "  'TPS212Background: Currently, there are no biomarkers validated prospectively in randomized studies for resected colon cancer (CC) to determine need for adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream represents a highly specific and sensitive approach (especially with serial monitoring) for identifying microscopic or residual tumor cells in CC patients (pts) and may outperform traditional clinical and pathological features in prognosticating risk for recurrence. CC pts who do not have detectable ctDNA (ctDNA-) are at a much lower risk of recurrence and may not need AC. Furthermore, for CC pts with detectable ctDNA (ctDNA+) who are at a very high risk of recurrence, the optimal AC regimen has not been established. We hypothesize that for pts whose colon cancer has been resected, ctDNA status may be used to risk stratify for making decisions about AC. Methods: In this prospective phase II/III trial, up to 1,912 pts with resected stage III A, B (all pts) and stage II, IIIC (ctDNA+ only) CC will be enrolled. Based on the post-operative ctDNA status using Natera’s Signatera assay, those who are ctDNA- (Cohort A) will be randomized to immediate AC with fluoropyrimidine (FP) + oxaliplatin (Ox) for 3-6 mos per established guidelines vs serial ctDNA monitoring. Patients who are ctDNA+ post-operatively or with serial monitoring (Cohort B) will be randomized to FP + Ox vs more intensive AC with addition of irinotecan (I) for 6 mos. The primary objectives for Cohort A are time to ctDNA+ status (phase II) and disease-free survival (DFS) in phase III in the immediate vs delayed AC arms. The primary objective for Cohort B is DFS in the FP + Ox vs FP + Ox + I arms for both phase II and phase III portions of the trial. Secondary objectives include prevalence of detectable ctDNA post-operatively, time-to event outcomes (overall survival & time to recurrence) by ctDNA status, and the assessment of compliance to adjuvant therapy. Biospecimens including archival tumor tissue, post-operative and serial matched/ normal blood samples will be collected for exploratory correlative research.

       "  'TPS213Background: Regorafenib (R) is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks several protein kinases involved in angiogenesis and oncogenesis; it has a survival benefit in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The current standard (std) treatment in patients (pts) with RAS wildtype (WT) mCRC is sequential treatment with an anti-EGFR antibody (AEA) followed by R. However, R, which is orally administered once daily, may be more convenient and thus preferable for pts than AEA. REVERCE, a Japanese trial, demonstrated a significant 5.8 month (mo.) survival benefit with regorafenib administered prior to AEA compared to the std sequence. Based off these findings, the proposed phase II trial is to confirm the observed survival benefit from regorafenib sequencing prior to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy in REVERCE in a US patient population. Methods: REVERCEII is an Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) network-led randomized phase II study of R (dose escalation from 80mg to 160mg based on tolerance) prior to AEA (R+AEA) compared to standard sequencing (AEA+R) in pts with refractory RAS WT mCRC. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive R (Arm A) vs. AEA (with or without irinotecan per investigator choice) (Arm B). At the time of disease progression or intolerance, patients will receive sequential treatment until disease progression. Eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed mCRC, ECOG ≤ 2, acceptable organ function, and patients must have had prior fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and no prior AEA nor R. The primary objective is to compare the overall survival (OS), the primary endpoint, between evaluable patients (eligible, consented, started protocol treatment) who were randomized to R+AEA (arm A) and AEA+R (arm B). With 83 OS events, we have 87% power to detect an improvement in median OS from 9 months to 14.5 mo., assuming 1-sided significance level of 0.15, and exponential distribution. The total sample size is 124 patients. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response, and adverse events. The total study duration is expected to be 3 years.

       "  'TPS214Background: Approximately 3% of patients (pts) with CRC have the oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) p.G12C mutation. Sotorasib, a small molecule that specifically and irreversibly inhibits the KRAS G12C mutant protein, has demonstrated modest clinical activity and no dose-limiting toxicities as a single agent in heavily pretreated pts with KRAS p.G12C-mutated CRC. The combination of sotorasib with other anticancer therapies, such as EGFR or MEK inhibitors, may enhance antitumor efficacy and counteract potential escape mechanisms. Other attractive partners for sotorasib in CRC include biologics and chemotherapy combinations. The CodeBreaK 101 master protocol is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of multiple sotorasib-based combinations in pts with KRAS p.G12C mutated solid tumors. Key subprotocols with CRC combination treatment arms are highlighted here. Methods: This is a phase 1b, open-label study evaluating sotorasib alone and in combination regimens in pts with advanced KRAS p.G12C mutated CRC, NSCLC, and other solid tumors. Key regimens being explored in CRC include (1) Subprotocol A: Sotorasib + trametinib (MEK inhibitor) +/- panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor), (2) Subprotocol H: Sotorasib + panitumumab and sotorasib + panitumumab + FOLFIRI, and (3) Subprotocol M: Sotorasib + bevacizumab-awwb + FOLFIRI or FOLFOX. Key eligibility criteria include advanced or metastatic solid tumor with KRAS p.G12C mutation identified through molecular testing in treatment-naïve and pretreated patients depending on cohort. Primary endpoints include dose-limiting toxicities and treatment-emergent or treatment-related adverse events. Secondary endpoints include PK profile of combination regimens and efficacy (objective response, disease control, duration of response, time to response, and progression-free survival assessed per RECIST 1.1, and overall survival).

       "  'TPS215Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be used to predict the risk of recurrence by detecting molecular residual disease (MRD) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although patients with MRD positive status have extremely high risk of relapse, no standard treatment has been established for these patients after adjuvant chemotherapy. Trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride (FTD/TPI) is an oral anti-tumor agent combining thymidine-based nucleoside analogue with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, which presents improved survival in patients with metastatic CRC refractory to fluoropyrimidines. Methods: The ALTAIR trial is a randomized, double-blind, phase III study designed to establish the superiority of FTD/TPI as compared with placebo in patients with resected CRC who show MRD positive status at any time after curative resection. ctDNA testing for screening patients with MRD positive is performed in the observational GALAXY study (UMIN000039205) that is a prospectively conducted large-scale nationwide registry designed to monitor ctDNA status for patient who can undergo curative resection. A personalized tumor-informed assay (Signatera bespoke multiplex-PCR NGS assay) is used for the detection and quantification of ctDNA-based postsurgical MRD. Key eligibility criteria are (a) having undergone radical resection of primary and/or metastatic tumors, (b) a history of standard adjuvant chemotherapy, (c) positive ctDNA status within the previous 3 months at any time postoperatively, and (d) no obvious relapse confirmed by chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 6 months of oral FTD/TPI or a matching course of placebo. Randomization is stratified by age (<70 vs. ≥70 years), stage (stage II or lower vs stage III vs. stage IV or M1), primary tumor location (right-sided vs left-sided colon vs rectum), ctDNA status at 1 month (positive vs negative or unmeasurable), and institution. The primary endpoint is disease free survival (DFS). Key secondary endpoints include rate of conversion from positive to negative ctDNA status, overall survival, adverse events, and quality of life. Assuming that the median DFS in the placebo group is approximately 8 months, a total of 240 patients (120 per arm) will provide 80% power to detect an expected DFS hazard ratio of 0.667 at two-sided significance level of 0.05, with an enrollment period of 2 years and a follow-up period of 1 year. This trial is actively accruing across 39 institutions in Japan and Taiwan and opened to recruitment in August 2018. By October 2021, a total of 67 patients have been enrolled.

       "  'TPS216Background: Checkpoint blockade therapy only benefits a small subset of GI cancer patients (approximately 4%) with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, which are characterized as immunologically ‘hot’ (Bonneville et\\xa0al., 2017). Most GI cancers, however, have microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, which have an immunologically “cold” phenotype with fewer genetic mutations, reduced immune cell infiltration, and downregulated immune checkpoint proteins. These attributes make MSS tumors resistant to conventional immunotherapy including checkpoint blockade therapy (Ooki et\\xa0al., 2021). Pelareorep is a naturally occurring, non-genetically modified reovirus. Upon intravenous administration, pelareorep selectively kills tumor cells and promotes several immunologic effects that prime tumors to respond to checkpoint blockade. These include the stimulation of tumor-directed innate and adaptive immune responses, increased T cell infiltration, expansion of new T cell clones, and increased PD-L1 expression in tumors (Samson et\\xa0al., 2018, Manso et\\xa0al. 2021 AACR). Given its expected synergy with checkpoint blockade, as well as its encouraging efficacy in prior GI cancer studies (Mahalingam et\\xa0al. 2020), the GOBLET study is designed to evaluate pelareorep plus atezolizumab in multiple GI cancer indications. Methods: GOBLET is an open-label, non-randomized, multiple-cohort, phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced or metastatic GI cancers. This study employs a Simon two-stage design. Stage 1 comprises four treatment groups: Cohort 1 – First-line pancreatic cancer treated with pelareorep plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) (N = 12); Cohort 2 – First-line MSI-H colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with pelareorep plus atezolizumab (N = 19); Cohort 3 – Third-line CRC treated with pelareorep plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (trifluridine/tipiracil) (N = 14); and Cohort 4 – Second-line or later squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal treated with pelareorep plus atezolizumab (N = 10). The first 3-6 patients enrolled into the chemotherapy-containing cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 3) comprise a safety run-in that must be successfully concluded prior to enrolling additional patients into these cohorts. The primary objectives are safety and efficacy based on objective response rate (ORR) at week 16. Any cohort showing a promising ORR in Stage 1, based on pre-specified criteria, may be advanced to Stage 2 and enroll additional patients. Clinical trial information: 2020-003996-16.',\n",

       "  'TPS218Background: Locally advanced rectal cancer is treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). While this trimodal approach achieves low rates of local recurrences, distant metastasis rates can exceed 25%. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) has been shown in OPRA, RAPIDO, and PRODIGE23 to reduce risk of distant metastasis and improve rates of pathological complete response compared to standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Thus, TNT not only addresses distant disease, but gives opportunity to reduce locoregional morbidity through organ preservation. We propose a treatment approach that incorporates TNT with FOLFOXIRI and up-front short-course radiation with the goal of increasing clinical complete response (cCR) rates and thereby eligibility for organ preservation. Currently, clinical response following neoadjuvant therapy is best assessed by a multidisciplinary team and includes flexible endoscopy and MRI. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis can be used as a noninvasive method for tumor monitoring. Biomarker development is essential to better select patients for treatment de-escalation and monitor for recurrence in order not to jeopardize the excellent cure rates following standard of care therapy. Methods: This is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized study of an organ preservation approach using short-course radiation followed by FOLFOXIRI for patients with > T2N0 or low T2N0, M0 rectal adenocarcinoma (NCT04380337). Patients undergo radiation (25 Gy/5 fractions + 5 Gy/1 fraction boost) followed by 8 cycles of FOLFOXIRI. Patients are assessed for response at 8 weeks following chemotherapy completion using pelvic MRI (MRI Tumor Regression Grading), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and digital rectal exam. Those who achieve a cCR can defer TME and be surveilled. The primary objective is to assess cCR, with the hypothesis that this approach will achieve higher cCR rates than historical controls (40 versus 20%). Secondary objectives include assessing toxicity, local regrowth rate, disease-free survival, colostomy-free survival, overall survival, and longitudinal health-related quality of life. ctDNA will be collected throughout treatment and surveillance, and correlative studies will assess the association between ctDNA levels and cCR, local regrowth, and disease-free survival. A Simon 2-stage design addressed our primary objective. Assuming a one-sided type 1 error of 0.1, power of 0.9, a null cCR of 0.2 versus an alternate cCR of 0.4, we plan to enroll 37 patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected if > = 11 patients have cCR. Seventeen patients have been enrolled and the trial is currently on hold for planned interim analysis for futility and safety. If < = 3 patients have cCR or if > = 7 patients have non-hematologic grade 4+ toxicity, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, we will continue to enroll 20 more patients.

       "  'TPS219Background: KRAS mutations (mts) are present in about 45% of CRC and predict lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy like cetuximab. Limited therapy options exist for pts after prior 5-FU based regimens. Regorafenib or TAS-102 is commonly used however, the modest clinical benefit, and toxicity limit their use. Novel therapies are needed for pts at this point in their disease course. KRAS G12D and G12V mts occur in 11-12% and 9-10% of CRC, respectively, whereas G12C mts occur in 3-4% of CRCs. KRAS G12C mts occur in 3-4% of CRCs. Recently, results of phase 1/2 KRYSTAL-1 study were reported. Adagrasib (a KRAS G12C inhibitor) was used with/without cetuximab in heavily pretreated CRC pts harboring KRAS G12C mts. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) was 43% and 100% (resp.) in pts receiving cetuximab and adagrasib (28 evaluable pts), and 22% and 87%, resp., in those receiving adagrasib alone (42 evaluable pts). Phase 1b CodeBreaK101 study evaluating sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) and panitumumab (anti-EGFR) combination in KRAS G12C mt CRC showed 15.4% confirmed ORR and 26.9% unconfirmed ORR. These data are encouraging, suggesting EGFR inhibition in combination with downstream KRAS inhibition may represent important therapeutic strategy for this disease. KRAS mts lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway signaling and cell activation. VS-6766 is a novel dual RAF/MEK inhibitor which has shown activity in KRAS mutated tumors. Combination of EGFR inhibition and VS-6766 may overcome resistance of KRAS mt CRC cancers to EGFR inhibition alone. Preclinically, VS-6766 and EGFR inhibition showed synergy in KRAS mt CRC cell lines, including cell lines harboring KRAS G12D and G12V mts, and CRC PDX of KRAS G12V mt CRC showed tumor regression with this combination. These data support the development of VS-6766 with anti-EGFR therapy in KRAS mt CRC warranting this phase 1 study to evaluate safety and efficacy of this combination in clinical settings. Methods: This is an open label, single arm study evaluating VS-6766 with cetuximab in pts with KRAS mt advanced CRC. Phase 1b primary endpoints include safety and tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose determination. ORR is the primary endpoint of the Phase 2 study. Secondary endpoints include OS and PFS. There will be upto 4 dose levels tested. Three de-escalation doses to find the optimal cetuximab dose, and one dose escalation of VS-6766, are planned. Eligible pts include those with metastatic CRC and progression after 5-FU, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and VEGFi therapy. Based on prior studies, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, ocular and CPK elevation have been the main toxicities noted with VS-6766. The study is funded by research grants from Verastem Oncology. Cetuximab will be supplied by Eli Lilly.',\n",

       "  'TPS220Background: For advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (5-FU or capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin) with VEGF inhibitors (bevacizumab) is standard first-line treatment. However, once this treatment had been used, the second line treatment is limited. Although continuation of bevacizumab after first progression can improve PFS and OS, the benefit of bevacizumab may be reduced compared with who never pre-treated with bevacizumab (the ML18147 study). Anlotinib is an oral small molecule tyrosine kinases inhibitor, targeting VEGF receptors 1/2/3, FGF receptors 1-4, PDGF receptors α/β and c-kit. mXELIRI is a chemotherapy regimen consisting of irinotecan and capecitabine. The trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with mXELIRI as second-line treatment in advanced colorectal cancer pre-treated with bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy. Methods: This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, 2-part, phase Ib/II study. Eligible pts are aged 18-75 years with histologically and radiographically confirmed mCRC who had progressed or intolerant with bevacizumab plus FOLFOX or CAPEOX regimen chemotherapy treatment. ECOG performance status 0 - 1, and adequate organ function. Treatment: anlotinib (8mg, 10mg or 12mg), po, qd, on days 1-14 every 3 weeks; irinotecan 180-200 mg/m2, iv, on day 1 every 3 weeks; capecitabine, 800 mg/m2, po, bid, on days 1-14 every 3 weeks. For the phase 1b segment, a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design is used to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of anlotinib. 3 patients are enrolled and treated per dose level (8mg,10mg,12mg). If no DLT, dose is escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients; If 1 DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at this level with dose escalation only if no additional DLTs；If ≥ 2 DLTs, prior dose level is defined as MTD. MTD decided when 6 patients are treated at a dose level with < 2 DLTs. Primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR) and quality of life (QoL). Based on a one-sided one sample log-rank test with 2.5% Type I error, 80% power to detect an improvement in ORR from 5.4% to 15%, there will be 94 patients consider 20% of patients fall off.

       "  'TPS221Background: Despite recent advances, effective treatment for GI cancers remains a significant unmet medical need. Gremlin-1 is secreted by the peri-tumoral stroma and down-regulates bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) -2, -4, and -7 (members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily), thereby allowing malignant cell expansion, renewal, and a more treatment-resistant mesenchymal phenotype. Gremlin-1 mRNA is highly expressed in multiple solid tumors including >60% of colorectal, pancreatic and esophageal cancers. UCB6114 is a first-in-class, fully human IgG4P monoclonal antibody optimized for neutralizing the activity of human Gremlin-1 thereby restoring BMP signaling. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that UCB6114 binds to Gremlin-1, inhibits its pharmacological activity, and has antitumor activity in several in\\xa0vivo mouse models (including several GI cancers). Methods: ONC001 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04393298) is an ongoing multi-part, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, Phase I/II study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antitumor activity of UCB6114 administered intravenously as monotherapy or in combination with selected standard of care (SOC) regimens. Eligible patients (pts) are: aged ≥18 years; resistant or refractory to standard therapy; ECOG performance status 0/1; and have adequate renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. In the Phase I monotherapy dose escalation and adaption part (part A and A1; modified rolling 6 design), up to 66 pts with advanced solid tumors associated with high levels of Gremlin-1 mRNA expression will be recruited. In parts B and C (modified toxicity probability interval design), up to 54 pts with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal, gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas will receive UCB6114 in escalating doses in combination with either mFOLFOX6 (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) or trifluridine/tipiracil, given at SOC dosing and schedules. The overarching objective of the phase I parts of the study (Parts A‒C) is to identify the recommended phase II dose of UCB6114 either as monotherapy or in combination. The primary objective is to characterize the safety profile of UCB6114; secondary and exploratory objectives include PK, antitumor activity (RECIST v1.1), and pharmacodynamics (including circulating Gremlin-1). Enrollment in ONC001 began in July 2020; as of Sept 2021, four dose escalation levels in the monotherapy dose-escalation module (Part A) have been completed without DLT. Recruitment to parts B and C is due to commence in Q4 2021. Clinical trial information: NCT04393298.',\n",

       "  'TPS222Background: Activation of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAILR2) induces apoptosis via caspase activation. Targeting TRAILR2 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, but some early TRAILR2 agonists were associated with severe hepatotoxicity. Cadherin 17 (CDH17), a membrane protein highly expressed in GI cancers, is not expressed in normal hepatocytes so using CDH17 as a liver-sparing anchor may avoid hepatotoxicity. BI 905711 is a tetravalent bispecific antibody that cross-links TRAILR2 with CDH17 to induce CDH17-dependent TRAILR2 oligomerisation. In preclinical assays, BI 905711 demonstrated a potency shift of ̃1000 fold versus the 1st-generation TRAILR2 agonist lexatumumab. BI 905711 induced apoptosis in CDH17-positive tumor cells in\\xa0vitro, impaired tumor growth in pt-derived colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts, and no hepatotoxicity was observed. Methods: This phase Ia/Ib study (NCT04137289) aims to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of BI 905711 in pts with advanced, refractory GI cancers. Up to 140 adult pts with histologically confirmed, advanced unresectable/metastatic colorectal, gastric, esophageal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or gallbladder or small intestine carcinoma, who have progressed on standard-of-care therapies, will be enrolled. In phase Ia, pts will receive intravenous BI 905711 at escalating doses (range 0.02–4.8 mg/kg) every 14 days, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first 28 days. In phase Ia, a minimum number of CRC pts will be enrolled to each cohort: ≥1 CRC pt at each of the 2 lowest dose levels (0.02/0.06 mg/kg) and 4 pts at each subsequent dose level (0.2/0.6/1.2/2.4/3.6/4.8 mg/kg). In parallel to dose escalation in CRC pts, up to 4 pts with non-CRC GI cancers will be included at the dose level below that of the CRC cohort. If an objective response (OR) per RECIST v1.1 is observed in CRC or non-CRC GI pts at a safe dose level, up to 10 additional pts with the same tumor type will be recruited at that dose level. In phase Ib, CRC pts will be randomized into up to 4 dose cohorts (as determined in phase Ia; n=20 each) to define the recommended phase II dose. The primary endpoints are determination of the MTD based on the proportion of pts with DLTs (phase Ia) and OR rate based on RECIST v1.1 (phase Ib). Secondary endpoints include PK parameters and OR in pts with measurable disease (phase Ia), and disease control, tumor shrinkage, duration of response, and progression-free survival (phase Ib).

       "  'TPS223Background: Patients with advanced colorectal cancer after progressing through first line therapy, have several FDA-approved systemic therapies that are associated with clinical benefit for a substantive minority of patients. Current clinical practice is to trial these various treatments in a step-wise fashion using CT scans every 3 months to evaluate effectiveness. This process requires 3-4 months between therapeutic interventions from which the patient may ultimately derive no clinical benefit, may have a performance status decline; limiting the number of possible interventions and increases risk for physical and financial toxicity. An alternative to the traditional CT-scan guided approach for disease assessment is a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) intervention. The Signatera ctDNA assay which utilizes 16 truncal mutations derived from a patient’s tumor, can be assessed every 2 weeks for a rapid determination of the effectiveness of a systemic therapy. This may allow patients to be exposed to many treatments during a short time, limiting toxicity, allowing for a quicker determination of clinical benefit and personalization of treatment. The aim of this study will be to compare the traditional scan-driven approach vs an intervention guided by ctDNA assessments, both arms using a pre-specified order of chemotherapy treatments. Methods: This is a phase 2 randomized study of patients with refractory metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. Participants are eligible after progression or intolerance to first line chemotherapy or recurrence within 6 months of adjuvant oxaliplatin based chemotherapy. They must have RECIST measurable metastatic disease that is not eligible for definitive management. Tissue from the primary and/or metastatic deposit is required for Signatera NGS analysis and subjects must have measurable ctDNA at sampling. Participants must be ≥18 years old without major organ dysfunction and have an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. Subjects with Microsatellite High, deficient in DNA mismatch repair genes, or BRAF V600E mutations are excluded. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A (ctDNA guided intervention) or Arm B (scan-guided control group). Patients in both arms will undergo systemic treatments in a standardized pre-specified order. Arm A will have ctDNA assessments every 2 weeks until an intervention shows a significant decrease, then every 4 weeks until Progressive Disease (PD) by scan or significant ctDNA increase. CT imaging will be performed every 12 weeks. Those in Arm B, will have CT imaging every 12 weeks and blood collected for post-hoc analysis every 4 weeks until PD by scan. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival and overall response. Exploratory analysis with be performed of the microbiome.

       "  'TPS224Background: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor (DXd). T-DXd has been approved to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (United States [US], Japan, Europe, Israel) and advanced gastric cancer (US, Japan, Israel). It is currently being evaluated in other solid tumor types including colorectal cancer. The phase 2 DESTINY-CRC01 study included patients with RAS wild-type mCRC, with a median 4 (range, 2-11) prior lines of therapy. Preliminary results in patients with HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) mCRC showed T-DXd treatment (6.4-mg/kg intravenously [IV] every 3 weeks [Q3W]) resulted in a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 45.3% (24/53; 95% CI, 31.6-59.6%) and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.1-not estimable; Siena J Clin Oncol. 2020). Activity was also seen in patients treated with prior anti-HER2 therapy. Although 5.4-mg/kg and 6.4-mg/kg doses of T-DXd have shown clinical efficacy in multiple cancer indications, the lower dose has not yet been tested in patients with HER2-overexpressing mCRC. Preliminary data also suggest T-DXd may be active in RAS mutant mCRC, unlike other anti-HER2 therapies. The DESTINY-CRC02 study aims to determine efficacy and safety of T-DXd in patients with HER2-overexpressing, RAS wild-type or mutant mCRC at 5.4-mg/kg and 6.4-mg/kg doses. Methods: DESTINY-CRC02 (NCT04744831) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel phase 2 study that will be conducted in 2 stages. Eligible patients (≥18 years; ≥20 years in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea) will have HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic CRC and have previously received chemotherapy, anti-EGFR therapy, anti-VEGF treatment, and/or anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, as clinically indicated. Prior anti-HER2 therapy will be allowed. In stage 1, patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive T-DXd IV Q3W at a dose of 5.4-mg/kg (n = 40; arm 1) or 6.4-mg/kg (n = 40; arm 2). Randomization will be stratified by ECOG PS (0 or 1), HER2 status (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+), and RAS status (wild-type or mutant). After stage 1 enrollment is complete, eligible patients in stage 2 (n = 40) will receive T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg until disease progression or other treatment discontinuation criteria are met. The study is actively enrolling and aims to enroll 120 patients across 60 sites. The primary objective is to assess efficacy of T-DXd at the 5.4-mg/kg and 6.4-mg/kg doses, with a primary endpoint of confirmed ORR by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed ORR, PFS, duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, overall survival, pharmacokinetics, and safety.

       "  'TPS225Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors monotherapy has limited clinical benefits in patients with MSS or pMMR metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), which may be attributed to low level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in MSS advanced CRC. Combination immunotherapy is changing the landscape of cancer treatment, especially combination of immunotherapy with small molecule angiogenesis inhibitors. Preclinical studies have shown that there is a time window from anti-angiogenesis to vascular normalization and this has been initially demonstrated in the clinical study of breast cancer. However, the time window is rarely considered in clinical practice. It is necessary to explore the optimal administration timing of angiogenesis inhibitors when combined with immunotherapy. Here, we conduct an open-label, single-center, phase II study to explore the issue. Methods: Patients eligible for the trial are included: 1) pathologically confirmed advanced colon or rectal adenocarcinoma, MSS or pMMR; 2) previously received only 2 standard regimens after recurrence or metastasis; 3) aged 18-70 years (boundary value included); 4) ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; 5) at least 3 months of survival expectations; 6) patient must present with measurable lesions according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST version 1.1; 7) patients with asymptomatic central nervous system metastases or asymptomatic brain metastases after treatment, with stable disease for at least 3 months, and need not be treated with steroids for at least 4 weeks; 8) had adequate organ function before the enrollment; 9) patients of reproductive age should agree to use effective contraceptive measures from the time of signing the informed form until 3 months after the last dose; 10) sign an informed consent form voluntarily, and be willing to and be able to follow and complete all experimental procedures. The patients enrolled were given oral fruquintinib (3 mg, qd, for 2 consecutive weeks, and then discontinued for 1 week, in 3 weeks [21 days] cycle); on the day 5, administered with intravenous camrelizumab (200mg, once every 3 weeks). The treatment was administered continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or required withdrawal from patients. The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and drug safety.

       "  'TPS226Background: Despite recent improvements, management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) remains challenging, and many patients (pts) still experience recurrence. In preclinical models, combining Rego with an anti-PD-1 inhibitor led to superior tumour growth suppression as compared with either treatment alone. In a phase I clinical trial, remarkable results were reported for the combination of Rego and Nivo in advanced MSS colorectal cancer. This synergistic effect is thought to be secondary to the anti-angiogenic effects of Rego and its potential to reduce TAMs, promote M1 macrophage conversion, and down-regulate expression of immunosuppressive factors. Building on these data, we designed a trial of Rego-Nivo with standard SCRT in the neoadjuvant setting of RC. Methods: REGINA is an academic, multicentre, single-arm, phase II trial sponsored by Institut Jules Bordet. Eligible patients are treated according to the following plan: induction phase (Nivo 240 mg IV D1&15, and Rego 80 mg PO D1-14), SCRT (D22-26), consolidation phase (Nivo 240 mg IV D29,43&57, and Rego 80 mg PO D29-49), and surgery (7-8 weeks after SCRT). Key eligibility criteria include age ≥18 years, ECOG PS ≤1, adenocarcinomas below the peritoneal reflection, intermediate-risk, stage II-III tumour (ie, cT3/T4aNany or cT1-2N+, no involvement/threatening of the mesorectal fascia, no involvement of lateral pelvic lymph nodes) irrespective of microsatellite instability status. The primary endpoint is pathological complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints include, among others, toxicity, compliance to treatment, pathological tumour regression grade, event-free survival, and overall survival. Subjects will be followed for recurrence and survival for 5 years after end of treatment visit. The study follows a Simon’s two-stage design (null hypothesis pCR = 12%, alternative hypothesis pCR = 24%; α= 5%, β= 20%) with a maximum of 60 pts to be enrolled. A safety interim analysis is planned after the first 6 pts have completed treatment. Serial collection of tumour, blood, and stool samples is mandatory at pre-specified time points for exploratory correlative biomarker analyses. The trial is planned to be run at 8-10 centres across Belgium. Study recruitment started in Q1 2021 and is anticipated to complete in Q3 2023. The study is funded by Bayer.

       "  'TPS227Background: The allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment CYAD-101 utilizes the NKG2D receptor that targets eight ligands expressed on tumor cells and also on stromal and immunosuppressive immune cells of the tumor microenvironment. CYAD-101 co-expresses a T-cell receptor (TCR) inhibitory peptide with the aim to eliminate the potential of graft versus host disease (GvHD), the main safety risk associated with engineered cells of allogeneic origin. In the previous alloSHRINK trial (NCT03692429), CYAD-101 was administered post FOLFOX preconditioning chemotherapy to 15 patients with progressive metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who were previously treated with FOLFOX. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated with no evidence of GvHD. The disease control rate was 73.3% with two patients presenting a confirmed partial response per RECIST’s criteria (4 months and 8 months of duration from first CYAD-101 infusion) and nine had stable disease with a median duration of 4.6 months. Evidence of increase in the TCR repertoire and modulation of the cytokine profile post-treatment with CYAD-101 were observed implying that CYAD-101 may also be modulating the immune suppressive environment in patients mirroring what was demonstrated in pre-clinical models. We considered that a sequential therapy with the anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab to further release the anti-tumor potential of this expanded T-cell population may drive deeper, more durable and new clinical responses beyond that currently demonstrated with the CAR T-cells alone. Methods: The phase 1b KEYNOTE-B79 trial (NCT04991948) will evaluate, according to a Simon’s two stage study design, the safety and clinical activity of three consecutive infusions of CYAD-101 (1x109 cells per infusion) post FOLFOX preconditioning chemotherapy with two-week interval between cycles, followed by pembrolizumab treatment (200 mg administered every three weeks for up to two years) in microsatellite stable/mismatch-repair proficient mCRC patients with recurrent/progressing disease after at least one metastatic line of therapy, which must include FOLFOX chemotherapy. The pembrolizumab treatment will be initiated 3 weeks after the last CYAD-101 infusion to fall outside the classical time window of potential CAR T-cell toxicities (e.g., cytokine release syndrome). The co-primary endpoints of the trial are the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at any time from the first FOLFOX preconditioning treatment up to 3 weeks after the first pembrolizumab treatment and the objective response rate (ORR) at the tumor assessment planned 6 weeks after the first pembrolizumab treatment administration. The KEYNOTE-B79 study will be initiated in Q4-2021 in five sites in USA and Europe. Clinical trial information: NCT04991948.',\n",

       "  'TPS229Background: Liver metastases (LMs) are usually found in gastrointestinal tumors, such as colorectal cancer (mCRC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cancer. Currently, there is no formal option for such patients (pts) due to the different pathological characteristics, and more effective treatment regimens are needed. Anlotinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR1-4, PDGFRα/β and c-Kit, which effectively blocks tumor neovascularization and growth. Previous phase II clinical trials suggested that anlotinib plus chemotherapy as first-line therapy were well tolerated and showed clinical anti-tumor activity in mCRC and ESCC. It was demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 76.7%, a disease control rate (DCR) of 93.3% and a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 11.4 months in RAS/BRAF wild-type unresectable mCRC pts using anlotinib plus CAPEOX (ALTER-C002 trial, NCT04080843). Additionally, preliminary encouraging ORR (78.3%), DCR (93.5%) and mPFS (8.38 months) was observed in advanced ESCC pts treated with anlotinib plus cisplatin and paclitaxel (ALTER-E002 trial, NCT04063683). Based on these results, this multicohort, multicenter phase II ALTER-G-001 trial was launched to evaluate efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus chemotherapy as first-line therapy in gastrointestinal tumor pts with unresectable LMs. Methods: Previously untreated and histologically or cytologically confirmed gastrointestinal tumor pts with unresectable LMs were eligible, who will be divided into 3 cohorts, including mCRC (n = 45), ESCC (n = 31) and others (n = 25). Pts must be aged 18-75 years, with an ECOG PS of 0/1, adequate organ function, and at least one measurable LMs lesion according to RECIST v1.1. HER2-positive gastric adenocarcinoma, and pts with a high risk of bleeding, perforation or fistulas will be excluded. During first 6 cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of inducing treatment, mCRC pts will receive anlotinib (12mg, po, qd, d1-d14), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2, iv, d1) and capecitabine (850 mg/m2, po, bid, d1-d14). ESCC pts will be treated with anlotinib, cisplatin (60-750 mg/m2, i.v., d1/d1-3) along with paclitaxel (135 mg/m2, i.v., d1) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2, i.v., d1). And pts in others cohort will receive anlotinib plus standard first-line chemotherapy. Then, pts without PD and LMs resection, will receive anlotinib and metronomic capecitabine (500mg, po. bid, d1-21, q3w) until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint is investigator-assessed ORR (RECIST 1.1). Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DoR), PFS, overall survival, DCR, radical resection rate for LMs and safety (NCI-CTCAE v5.0).

       "  'TPS230Background: RAS status in tumor tissue is a predictive factor for the efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies therapy in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In mCRC pts with tumors harboring RAS mutation, anti-EGFR antibodies therapy has the lack of clinical benefit; thus, the survival of RAS mutant mCRC pts is shorter compared to RAS wild mCRC pts. Recently, several studies have shown that colorectal cancer tissue had heterogeneity of gene profiling, and the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood samples could detect the change of gene alterations in tumors which were caused by chemotherapy. Bouchahda et\\xa0al., demonstrated that nearly half of the pts with RAS mutant mCRC had no detectable RAS mutation in ctDNA after first-line chemotherapy; moreover, some of the pts had clinical benefits from post-anti-EGFR antibodies therapy. Therefore, anti-EGFR antibodies therapy might become a novel treatment option for RAS mutant mCRC pts without RAS mutations in ctDNA after chemotherapies. Other report also showed the frequency of no RAS mutations in ctDNA was about 1%. There have been few studies to prospectively evaluate the RAS status in ctDNA for mCRC pts with RAS mutant tumors treated with standard chemotherapies. We, therefore, conducted an observational study to evaluate RAS mutations and the mutation allele frequency in ctDNA for mCRC pts with RAS mutant tumors who were treated with first- or second-line chemotherapy. Methods: This study is a multi-center observational/translational study in 67 facilities. The key eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status 0-1, 2) histologically proven unresectable mCRC, 3) RAS mutation in tumor tissue, 4) refractory or intolerable after response to prior fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen. OncoBEAM RAS CRC kit is used to investigate RAS status in ctDNA just after first- or second-line treatment in enrolled pts. The primary endpoint is the frequency of pts without RAS mutations in ctDNA. Secondary endpoints include mutation allele frequency of RAS in ctDNA and clinical outcomes of pre- and post-treatments (overall response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, and progression-free survival). As the exploratory analysis, gene alterations related to the resistant mechanism of anti-EGFR antibodies (BRAF, PIK3CA, ERBB2, MET) are analyzed in pts without RAS mutations in ctDNA. We assume that no RAS mutations are observed in ctDNA in at least 1 % pts. We expect that one patient with no RAS mutations in ctDNA is detected in 100 pts; thus, the sample size of 300 pts is set for our study. Accrual is starting in April 2021.

       "  'TPS231Background: Advances in multi-modality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) have resulted in low local recurrence rates, but many patients still die from distant disease. There is increasing recognition that with neoadjuvant treatment some patients achieve a complete response and may avoid surgical resection. The PRIME-RT trial tests the inclusion of neoadjuvant immunotherapy with the aim of enhancing complete response rates, improving stoma-free survival and reducing distant relapse. Methods: PRIME-RT is a multi-centre, open label, phase II, randomised trial for patients with newly diagnosed LARC. Eligible patients are randomised to Arm A: short course radiotherapy (25 Gray in 5 fractions) with concomitant durvalumab, followed by durvalumab and FOLFOX chemotherapy, or Arm B: long course chemoradiotherapy (50 Gray to primary tumour, 45 Gray to elective nodes, in 25 fractions with capecitabine) with concomitant durvalumab followed by FOLFOX and durvalumab. The primary endpoint is complete response rate in each arm. Bio-specimens including serial tumour biopsies and peripheral blood samples are collected prior to, during, and following treatment to explore the molecular and immunological factors underpinning treatment response. The main trial will recruit up to 42 patients and commence after a safety run-in (n≥6) which is recruiting patients with metastatic disease. After opening in January 2021, three patients have been treated within the safety run-in; 2 in Arm A and 1 in Arm B. Early recruitment to PRIME-RT has shown that adding immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for LARC is feasible. The expectation is that the trial will provide efficacy and safety information which allows the optimal treatment approach to be tested within a larger phase clinical trial.

We hypothesize that the dMMR/MSI-H mCRC pts may be more effectively treated by the combination of PD-1 pathway blockade and mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab (bev) rather than with anti-PD-1 therapy (atezo) alone. Preclinical work demonstrated synergistic effects between anti-PD-1/anti-VEGF and between oxaliplatin/anti-PD-1 in murine CRC models and phase II data showed activity of anti-PD-1/anti-VEGF in chemotherapy refractory colon cancer. Additionally, in other solid tumor malignancies, anti-PD1 plus anti-VEGFr (i.e., HCC and RCC) as well as anti-PD1 plus chemotherapy (i.e., gastric and esophageal cancers) combinations are standard first-line treatments. Methods: The redesigned COMMIT study was reactivated on 1/29/2021 as a two-arm prospective phase III open-label trial randomizing (1:1) mCRC dMMR/MSI-H (211 pts) to atezo monotherapy versus mFOLFOX6/bev+atezo combination. Assuming our control arm, atezo monotherapy, 48% PFS at 24 months, as assessed by site investigator, we have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 (equivalent to 64.4% PFS at 24 months) with alpha 0.025 one-sided. Stratification factors include BRAFV600E status, metastatic site, and prior adjuvant CRC therapy. Secondary endpoints include OS, objective response rate, safety profile, disease control rate, duration of response, and centrally-reviewed PFS.

       "  'TPS233Background: There are currently no validated predictive biomarkers for stage II resected colon cancer (CC) after adjuvant chemotherapy. However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream represents a highly specific and sensitive approach for identifying microscopic or residual tumor cells. For patients (pts) with CC, the detection of ctDNA is associated with persistent disease after resection and may outperform traditional clinical and pathological features in prognosticating risk for recurrence. We hypothesize that for pts whose stage II colon cancer has been resected and who have no traditional high-risk features, a positive ctDNA status may identify those who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: In this prospective phase II/III clinical trial, pts (N = 1,408) with resected stage II CC without traditional high-risk features and whom the evaluating oncologist deems suitable for active surveillance (i.e., not needing adjuvant chemotherapy) will be randomized 1:1 into 2 arms: standard-of-care/observation (Arm A), or prospective testing for ctDNA (Arm B). Postoperative blood will be analyzed for ctDNA with the Guardant Reveal assay, covering CC-relevant mutations and CC-specific methylation profiling. Pts in Arm B with ctDNA detected will be treated with 6 months of adjuvant (FOLFOX) chemotherapy. For all pts in Arm A, ctDNA status will be analyzed retrospectively at the time of endpoint analysis. The primary endpoints are clearance of ctDNA with adjuvant chemotherapy (phase II) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for “ctDNA-detected” pts treated with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (phase III). Secondary endpoints will include time-to-event outcomes (OS, RFS, TTR) by ctDNA marker status and treatment, prevalence of detectable ctDNA in stage II CC, and rates of compliance with assigned intervention. Archived normal and matched tumor and blood samples will be collected for exploratory correlative research. Enrollment continues across North America to the 540-patient phase II endpoint.

A commonly employed TNT protocol consists of 8 biweekly cycles of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (CT) followed by radiation concurrent with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (CRT) for about 6 weeks. During the TNT, patients undergo tumor response assessments periodically with standard modalities (SM) consisting of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proctoscopic/endoscopic examination. The objective of the current protocol is to evaluate the feasibility of tumor response assessment by ctDNA in patients with LARC undergoing TNT. The present feasibility study is designed to collect preliminary data to evaluate if a subsequent larger validation study is justified. If ctDNA-based response assessment is validated, ctDNA can potentially replace at least some components of the SM (for example, MRI) as tumor response assessment by SM is often time-consuming, expensive, and poses logistical challenges. Methods: Patients with LARC undergoing TNT will be enrolled. After obtaining informed consent, venous blood samples will be obtained for ctDNA level measurements at the following time points: baseline (within 1 week before the CT begins), after 4 cycles of CT within +/- 5 days of the MRI study, after 8 cycles of CT within +/- 5 days of the MRI study, and 1 to 14 days before TME. ctDNA levels will be measured by a commercially available ctDNA assay (Signatera by Natera), and ctDNA response is defined as >90% drop in the ctDNA level after treatment compared to the baseline level. Tumor response will be evaluated after 4 and 8 cycles of CT by SM. Primary endpoint: correlation between the response rate (RR) assessed by ctDNA and by SM after 4 cycles of CT. Secondary endpoints: 1) correlation between the RR assessed by ctDNA and by SM after 8 cycles of CT, and 2) correlation between the ctDNA defined RR and the complete pathological response (pCR) rate. The trial will enroll 30 patients. To evaluate the primary endpoint, differences in ctDNA levels between the baseline and 4-cycles post-CT will be computed. The differences will then be expressed as a proportion of each patient’s baseline level, D. This relative change, D, will be compared between the responder and non-responder groups using a two-sample Welch’s t-test. Similar methods will be applied for the secondary endpoints. All analyses will use the nominal type I error level of 0.05 and two-sided tests. Clinical trial information: NCT04670588.',\n",

       "  'TPS235Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a biomarker for non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of tumor progression in cancer management. Through the recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and personalized assays, ctDNA has been heralded as a promising tool to detect residual disease, relapse, and monitor treatment response in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Our study aims to determine whether treatment related ctDNA dynamics can be used as a reliable indicator to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Methods: This is a prospective observational cohort study. The primary aim is to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA clearance in predicting pCR in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. The secondary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of using ctDNA as a surveillance method to detect progression of rectal cancer during neoadjuvant therapy and relapse in the subsequent follow up period. ctDNA levels are collected from newly diagnosed rectal cancer patients at 7 discrete time points: at diagnosis or screening, during neoadjuvant therapy, after completion of neoadjuvant therapy and 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months after surgery. This will be followed by every 3 months ctDNA testing for surveillance for up to 2 years. We expect to enroll approximately 30 patients at our institution. The subjects will be sorted into two groups: responders and non-responders based on whether they achieve pCR. ctDNA level between two groups will subsequently be compared. The use of ctDNA to predict pCR in rectal cancer patients may allow for many of these patients to safely avoid surgery if undetectable ctDNA at the end of neoadjuvant therapy strongly correlates with pCR. We are actively enrolling patients into this prospective observational study and expect to report the data in the near future. The data we obtain will be combined with those from several institutions around the US doing similar studies with the same test. Data analysis will subsequently be conducted.

       "  'TPS236Background: Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the bloodstream is emerging as a novel marker for identifying of radiographically occult microscopic or minimal residual disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (pts) after curative intent treatments. Accumulating data suggest that ct-DNA defined MRD is a highly specific prognostic biomarker for future recurrences with a lead time of several months and prospective clinical trials are being conducted using ct-DNA defined MRD as an integral biomarker for improving risk stratification for adjuvant chemotherapy decision making. However, large scale, prospective data regarding kinetics of ctDNA-defined MRD with accurate pre-analytical methodology for plasma isolation and paired clinical data are limited. Methods: In this multi-center, prospective observational study, 1,000 pts with resectable CRC (stages II – IV) without other active malignancies undergoing therapy with curative intent will be enrolled any time from time of diagnosis up to start of adjuvant therapy (or ≤ 3 months post curative surgery, whichever is earlier). All therapeutic and surveillance visits decisions are at the discretion of the treating physicians. Serial biospecimens including blood (in Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes) to be processed to plasma and buffy coat in ≤ 2 days and formalin fixed tumor tissue will be collected at key time points until the time of radiographic recurrence or up to 5 years of surveillance. Blood draws will be at study entry, after each line of neoadjuvant therapy, post-surgery, during and after adjuvant therapy in addition to each surveillance visit. These blood draws will be coordinated with pts’ standard of care visits in order to minimize additional venipunctures. Relevant clinical data including demographics, cancer history, treatment details and outcomes, serum tumor markers and genomic data will be collected at each time point. Samples will be evaluated retrospectively with a primary objective of evaluating sensitivity and specificity of post-operative MRD for radiographic recurrences utilizing Guardant Health’s Reveal assay. Other key objectives include evaluating ctDNA kinetics with neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies and to correlate with outcomes. The study is active, and enrollment is ongoing.

       "  'TPS237Background: Molecular characterisation of colorectal cancer (CRC) has demonstrated the regulatory role of epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, in CRC tumorigenesis(1). Robust molecular profiling of CRC has the potential to provide critical diagnostic and prognostic information. The establishment of 4 consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs), developed initially for primary CRC tumours, resulted in the evolving framework for molecularly targeted interventions; the molecular genetic profile characterising mCRC is less well defined(3, 4). Previous pilot work identified a unique tumour-specific methylation sequence, at 376 sites within the DNA of mCRC cells(5). This study will assess whether this methylation sequence drives mCRC pathogenesis and underpins disease phenotype. The primary aim of this study is validation of the diagnostic utility of this novel enhancer signature and identification of key enhancers with the potential to direct targeted treatment development. Secondary aims include CRISPR knockdown library development targeting the enhancers in CRC cells in\\xa0vitro, evaluating the impact of the knockdown on phenotype in\\xa0vitro, and identifying the mechanisms by which methylation-sensitive enhancers regulate the mCRC phenotype. Methods: This is a retrospective, non-interventional, single-centre clinical study, including patients > 18 years, with (group A) de novo mCRC (n = 100), (group B) stage III colorectal cancer that subsequently relapsed (n = 100) or (group C) stage III colorectal cancer without radiological evidence of relapse at study enrolment (n = 100). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue obtained at diagnosis will be analysed. Additionally, 50 stage III patients who have relapsed (group B) will have blood samples collected prospectively at time of consent to enable assessment for the presence of the methylation signature on ctDNA. The presence or absence of the novel methylation signature will be evaluated via the application of a targeted bisulfite sequencing panel consisting of the previously identified differentially methylated enhancer (DME) signature to both tissue and plasma samples; results will be correlated with conventional histological parameters, systemic therapy, and overall survival. Quantitative statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS with linear regression analysis for survival data.

JCOG1109 (UMIN000009482) compared the doublet and triplet of chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. Methods: Eligible patients (pts) with ESCC of clinical stage IB, II, III (excluding T4) (UICC 7th) from 44 institutions were randomized 1:1:1 to neoadjuvant CF (cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day1 plus 5-FU 800 mg/m2 on days 1-5 Q3W/2course), DCF (docetaxel 70 mg/m2 on day 1, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day1, plus 5-FU 750 mg/m2 on days 1-5 Q3W/3 course), or CF-RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 plus 5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1-4 Q4W/2course, radiation 41.4 Gy/23 fr). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), %R0 resection, %objective response by neoadjuvant therapy, %pathological complete response (pCR) and safety. Differences in OS was assessed in the ITT using the stratified log-rank test. The data cutoff date for the analysis was July 20, 2021. Results: Of 601 pts 199 CF, 202 DCF, and 200 CF-RT were enrolled from December 5, 2012 to July 20, 2018, respectively. Among 601 pts, 88.2% were male, median (range) age was 65 (30-75), clinical stage III (nonT4) pts were 62.6%. Median follow-up time (range) was 4.2 years (y) (0-8.5). Median OS in CF, DCF, and CF-RT arm were 4.6 y, not reached (NR), and 6.0y, and 3-year OS was 62.6%, 72.1%, and 68.3%, respectively (stratified log-rank test: p = 0.006 for CF vs. DCF and p = 0.12 for CF vs. CF-RT). By stratified Cox regression analysis for OS, hazard ratios (HR) [95% CI] was 0.68 [0.50–0.92] for CF vs. DCF and 0.84 [0.63–1.12] for CF vs. CF-RT. Median PFS in CF, DCF, and CF-RT arm were 2.7 y, NR, and 5.3 y, and 3-year PFS was 47.7%, 61.8%, and 58.5%, respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 168 (84.4%), 173 (85.6%), and 175 (87.5%), and pCR was 4 (2.1%), 40 (19.8%), and 77 (38.5%), respectively. During neoadjuvant therapy, febrile neutropenia in CF, DCF, and CF-RT arm were 1.0%, 16.3% and 4.7%, and esophagitis (grade>3) were 1.0%, 1.0% and 8.9%, respectively. The treatment-related death was seen in 3 (1.5%), 4 (2.0%), and 2 (1.0%), in CF, DCF, and CF-RT arm, respectively. Conclusions: DCF significantly improved OS over CF as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced ESCC, with a manageable toxicity profile. DCF represents a new standard neoadjuvant treatment for ESCC.

Clinically meaningful long-term survival benefit with NIVO + chemo vs chemo was observed with 24 months (mo) of minimum follow-up in all randomized patients (pts) for both OS (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.71–0.88]) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.70–0.89]; Janjigian YY et\\xa0al; ESMO 2021). We present expanded analyses of NIVO + chemo vs chemo with minimum follow-up of 24 mo. Methods: Adults with previously untreated, unresectable advanced or metastatic GC/GEJC/EAC were enrolled regardless of PD-ligand (L)1 expression. Pts with known HER2-positive status were excluded. Pts were randomized to NIVO (360 mg Q3W or 240 mg Q2W) + chemo (XELOX Q3W or FOLFOX Q2W), NIVO 1 mg/kg + IPI 3 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses, then NIVO 240 mg Q2W), or chemo. Dual primary endpoints were OS and PFS (per blinded independent central review) in pts with PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 5 for NIVO + chemo vs chemo. Hierarchically tested secondary endpoints included OS in NIVO + chemo vs chemo (PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, then all randomized). Results: Of 2031 pts, 1581 were randomized to NIVO + chemo or chemo. In all randomized pts, 41% of pts (NIVO + chemo) and 44% of pts (chemo) received subsequent therapy. Median PFS2 (time from randomization to progression after subsequent systemic therapy, initiation of second subsequent systemic therapy, or death, whichever is earlier) was 12.2 (95% CI 11.3–13.5) mo with NIVO + chemo and 10.4 (95% CI 9.7–11.2) mo with chemo (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.67–0.84]). 51% of pts (NIVO + chemo) and 43% of pts (chemo) had > 50% reduction from baseline in tumor burden, while 24% and 17% had > 80% reduction, respectively. The HR (95% CI) for OS was 0.66 (0.56–0.77) among pts with a PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 (median OS for NIVO + chemo vs chemo: 15.0 [95% CI 13.7–16.7] vs 10.9 [95% CI 9.8–11.9] mo). OS benefit was observed with NIVO + chemo vs chemo across multiple additional subgroups, and these data will be presented. No new safety signals were identified. The majority of the treatment-related adverse events with potential immunologic etiology were grade 1 or 2 and grade 3 or 4 events were reported in ≤ 5% of pts in both treatment arms. Conclusions: NIVO + chemo continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy and an acceptable safety profile with longer follow-up, further supporting the use of NIVO + chemo as a standard 1L therapy in previously untreated pts with advanced GC/GEJC/EAC.

We report efficacy, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results with an additional 12 months (mo) of follow-up. Methods: 749 eligible pts were randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg or placebo Q3W for up to 2 yr + chemo. Randomization was stratified by geographic region, histology, and performance status. Treatment continued until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal, or 2 yr. No crossover was permitted. Primary endpoints were OS in pts with ESCC PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥10 tumors, and OS and PFS (RECIST v1.1; by INV) in ESCC, PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and all pts. Secondary endpoints included ORR, DOR, safety, and HRQoL. HRQol was assessed in 711 treated pts with ≥1 HRQoL assessment (356 pembro + chemo; 355 chemo). Data cutoff was July 9, 2021. Results: At data cutoff, median follow-up (randomization to data cutoff) was 34.8 mo. Median OS was longer with pembro + chemo vs chemo in pts with ESCC CPS ≥10 (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76), ESCC (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.88), CPS ≥10 (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80), and all pts (HR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.63-0.86). In pts with adenocarcinoma OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.55-0.99). The 24-mo OS rate in all pts was 26.3% vs 16.1%. Median PFS was longer with pembro + chemo vs chemo in ESCC (HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.78), CPS ≥10 (HR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65), and all pts (HR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.75). The 24-mo PFS rate in all pts was 11.6% vs 3.3%. Confirmed ORR was 45.0% (25 CR [6.7%]) vs 29.3% (9 CR [2.4%]), with median DOR of 8.3 vs 6.0 mo. Approximately 20% vs 6% of pts had response duration ≥24 months. Grade 3-5 drug-related AE rates were 72% vs 68%. Discontinuation rates from drug-related AEs were 21% vs 12%. There was no significant difference in least square mean (LSM) change from baseline to wk 18 between arms in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/quality-of-life (LSM difference -0.10; 95% CI, -3.40-3.20). LSM change from baseline to wk 18 was better with pembro + chemo vs chemo for QLQ-OES 18 pain (-2.94; 95% CI, -5.86 to -0.02) and dysphagia (-5.54; 95% CI, -10.92 to -0.16). Conclusions: With an additional 12 months of follow-up, pembro + chemo continued to provide significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR vs chemo with a manageable safety profile, and stable quality-of-life for pts with untreated, advanced esophageal and EGJ cancer. These data continue to support 1L pembro + chemo as a new standard of care in these patients. Clinical trial information: NCT03189719.',\n",

       "  '242Background: T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti-HER2 antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor. DESTINY-Gastric01 (DS8201-A-J202; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03329690) is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 2 trial of T-DXd in patients with HER2–positive advanced gastric cancer (GC) or GEJ adenocarcinoma. In the primary analysis (101 OS events; median survival follow-up, 12.3 mo), T-DXd showed statistically significant benefit vs standard chemotherapy in objective response rate (ORR) and OS (Shitara K, et\\xa0al. N Engl J Med. 2020;382:2419-2430); here, we present the final OS analysis as well as updated efficacy and safety. Methods: Patients (pts) with locally advanced or metastatic, centrally confirmed HER2–positive (IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+ on archival tissue) GC or GEJ cancer that had progressed after ≥2 previous lines of therapy including trastuzumab were randomly assigned 2:1 (T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg Q3W or physician’s choice [PC] of irinotecan [I] or paclitaxel [P]). Pts were stratified by country, ECOG performance status (0, 1), and HER2 status. Primary endpoint was ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints were OS, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), confirmed ORR, and safety. Final OS analysis was performed at 133 OS events. Results: 187 pts received T-DXd (n = 125) or PC (n = 62 [55 I; 7 P]); 79.7% of pts were Japanese and 20.3% were Korean. Pts had a median of 2 prior lines of therapy, and 44.4% had ≥3. At data cutoff (June 3, 2020), 8% of T-DXd and 0% of PC pts remained on treatment (median survival follow-up, 18.5 mo). OS was improved with T-DXd vs PC (median OS, 12.5 vs 8.9 mo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.60 [95% CI, 0.42-0.86]); 12-month OS, 52.2% vs 29.7%. ORR was 51.3% (61/119; 11 CR; 50 PR) with T-DXd vs 14.3% (8/56; all PR) with PC (P< 0.0001); confirmed ORR, 42.0% (50/119; 10 CR; 40 PR) vs 12.5% (7/56; all PR) (P= 0.0001); DCR, 85.7% vs 62.5% (P= 0.0005); confirmed median DOR, 12.5 vs 3.9 mo; median PFS, 5.6 vs 3.5 mo (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.71]; P= 0.0003). Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 85.6% of T-DXd pts vs 56.5% with PC; the most common were neutrophil count decreased (51.2%, 24.2%), anemia (38.4%, 22.6%), and white blood cell count decreased (20.8%, 11.3%). 16 pts (12.8%) had T-DXd–related interstitial lung disease (ILD; 13 grade 1/2, 2 grade 3, 1 grade 4, no grade 5) vs 0 with PC. As reported in the primary analysis, there was 1 T-DXd–related death from pneumonia (non-ILD). Conclusions: With additional follow-up after the primary analysis, T-DXd continued to demonstrate OS benefit and clinically relevant improvement in ORR compared with standard chemotherapy, and a manageable safety profile, in HER2–positive advanced GC or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

       "  '243Background: KEYNOTE-062 (NCT02494583) is a global phase 3 study of pembrolizumab (pembro) as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy (chemo) versus chemo as first-line therapy for PD-L1–positive (combined positive score [CPS] ≥1) advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. At the time of the protocol-specified final analysis, pembro was noninferior to chemo, with fewer adverse events (AEs) observed. Pembro or pembro + chemo was not superior to chemo for the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) end points tested. We present the results of KEYNOTE-062 after ̃25 additional months of follow-up (cutoff: April 19, 2021). Methods: Patients with previously untreated gastric or GEJ cancer were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W, pembro + chemo (cisplatin 80 mg/m2/day on day 1 + 5-FU 800 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 Q3W [or capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 Q3W per local guidelines]), or placebo Q3W + chemo. Primary end points were OS in the CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 populations for pembro + chemo versus chemo and pembro versus chemo and PFS (RECIST v1.1; central review) in the CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 populations for pembro + chemo versus chemo. Safety was also evaluated. Results: At the time of data cutoff, 689 of 763 patients (90.3%) had died. Median follow-up (defined as time from randomization to data cutoff) was 54.3 months (range, 46.8-66.1). Pembro was noninferior to chemo for OS in the CPS ≥1 population (median, 10.6 vs 11.1 months; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.08) but had a clinically meaningful OS benefit in the CPS ≥10 population (median, 17.4 vs 10.8 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.86). 24-month OS rates (pembro vs chemo) were 26.6% versus 18.8% in the CPS ≥1 population and 39.1% versus 21.1% in the CPS ≥10 population. Pembro + chemo was not superior to chemo for OS in the CPS ≥1 (median, 12.5 vs 11.1 months; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71-1.02) or the CPS ≥10 (median, 12.3 vs 10.8 months; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.03) population. 24-month OS rates (pembro + chemo vs chemo) were 24.5% versus 18.8% in the CPS ≥1 population and 28.3% versus 21.1% in the CPS ≥10 population. Pembro + chemo did not significantly prolong PFS versus chemo in the CPS ≥1 (median, 6.9 vs 6.5 months; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70-1.01) or the CPS ≥10 (median, 5.8 vs 6.2 months; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96) population. Grade 3-5 treatment-related AEs rates were 17.3% (pembro), 73.2% (pembro + chemo), and 69.3% (chemo). Conclusions: After ̃25 additional months of follow-up, efficacy and safety outcomes with first-line pembro or pembro + chemo versus chemo in patients with gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma enrolled in KEYNOTE-062 were consistent with the final analysis data.

       "  '244Background: In pts with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma or OGA, radical surgery is the only curative option and perioperative chemotherapy seems worthless for those with MSI/dMMR tumors. Methods: We conducted phase II study evaluating the efficacy of neo-adjuvant nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by adjuvant nivolumab in pts with resectable MSI/dMMR, T2-T4 NxM0 tumors. Treatment consisted of nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (6 infusions) and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (2 infusions), followed by radical surgery 5 weeks (±1 week) after last injection of nivolumab. Pts with Becker tumor regression grade (TRG) < 3 were treated with adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks (9 infusions). The primary objective was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Results: From 10/2019 to 06/2021, a total of 32 pts were enrolled (all had dMMR±MSI-H status; 16 with gastric cancer and 16 with OGA). The median age was 65.5 years (range, 40-80). Initial stage was: usT3Nx = 22, usT2Nx = 4, and usTxNx = 6 (not evaluable by ultrasound endoscopy). At data lock, 32 pts had terminated neo-adjuvant period and 27 (84%) completed all 6 neo-adjuvant cycles. 8 pts (32%) experienced G3/4 adverse events (AEs) during neo-adjuvant treatment. 29 pts underwent surgery; 2 refused surgery and had complete endoscopic response with tumor-free biopsies, 1 had surgery not performed in relation with a metastatic progression. The median delay between last injection and surgery was 35 days (extreme, 25-170). Overall surgical morbidity (54%, n = 14) was related to: anastomotic leakage = 4, pancreatitis = 2, pneumonia = 2, and other = 6. The incidence of post-operative mortality was 3.8% (n = 1) due to cardiovascular AE at post-operative day 3. All the 29 pts who underwent surgery had R0 resection: 17 (59%) had pCR (i.e., TRG 1a as per Becker grade, ypT0N0) and 4 (14%) had TRG 1b as per Beker grade (< 10% residual tumor per tumor bed). 1 pt had TRG 2 (10-50% of residual tumor) and 7 pts had TRG 3 (˃50% of residual tumor) as per Becker grade, per local pathological assessment (central pathological review is awaited). With a median follow-up of 10.9 months, 1 pt had metastatic relapse, 1 pt died without relapse and 30 pts were recurrence/progression-free. Conclusions: Neo-adjuvant therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is feasible and is associated with a high pCR rate in pts with MSI/dMMR resectable OGA. Data will be updated for the congress.

       "  '245Background: Nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated survival benefit in previously treated gastric cancer (GC) patients (pts) (Kang YK, et\\xa0al. Lancet 2017) and was involved into standard of care in advanced GC. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were observed in about 10% of pts treated with immune-check point inhibitor. Several studies revealed that the toxicities of anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy was associated with composition of gut microbiome, but little is known about GC. We therefore investigated whether host-related factors including genomic information in gut microbiome will serve as predictors for nivolumab-induced toxicities in advanced GC. Methods: The observational/translational study (DELIVER trial: UMIN000030850) has enrolled 501 pts with advanced GC treated with nivolumab alone from March 2018 to August 2019 to evaluate real-world data and discover host-related biomarkers using fecal and blood samples which were collected before treatment with nivolumab [Takahashi Y, et\\xa0al. Gastric Cancer 2021]. In the biomarker part, the relationship between markers of microbiome/genetic polymorphisms and AEs was evaluated as previously planned for the secondary endpoint. Genomic data in fecal samples and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in blood samples were measured by genome shotgun sequence and microarray, respectively, at central lab. Genera and pathway with a median difference of ≥0.01 of normalized value and P-value < 0.05 of t-test were picked up from the first 200 pts (training cohort) and then confirmed in the last 301 pts (validation cohort). Comparison analysis between pts with and without each AE was performed for SNPs in all pts. Results: In the safety population with 487 pts, at the time of 1 year after last patient enrollment, each AE was 87 for diarrhea, 44 for skin eruptions, 29 for hypothyroidism, and 11 for adrenal disorders. In the analysis of gut microbiome, 180 of 200 pts and 257 of 301 pts were available for massive metagenomic in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. Four hundred-forty pts were available for analyzing SNPs. Arthrobacter and fatty acid metabolism pathway were identified for candidate markers to predict skin AEs in the training cohort (p= 0.021 and p= 0.024, respectively) and then confirmed in the validation cohort (p= 0.011 and p= 0.011, respectively). Patient with high level of the genus or pathway experienced skin AEs more frequently. The SNPs analysis indicated the significant association of genetic polymorphisms of NLRC5 and IL6R with skin toxicities and NOTCH1 and SEMA4D with diarrhea. Conclusions: Genus of Arthrobacter and fatty acid metabolism pathway in gut microbiome predict skin toxicities in advanced GC treated with nivolumab. In addition, some SNPs may potentially become markers for skin toxicities and diarrhea of nivolumab. Clinical trial information: UMIN000030850.',\n",

       "  '246Background: Neoantigens are short peptides derived from tumor-specific somatic mutations that can bind to HLA molecules and be presented on the cell surface to activate the immune system. Recognition of neoantigens by autologous T cells promotes sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade of mismatch repair deficient (MMRd)/microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) tumors. Neoantigen-targeted reactivity by autologous T cells has also been reported in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. We aimed to comprehensively assess the spectrum of neoantigens in upper GI cancers and identify recurrent immunogenic candidate neoantigens. Methods: 600 tumor specimens including 268 esophageal (EC), 211 gastric (GC), and 121 gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers tested at Caris Life Sciences (Phoenix, AZ) with NextGen Sequencing (NGS) on DNA (whole exome) and RNA (whole transcriptome) were analyzed. MSI status was determined by immunohistochemistry of MMR protein and/or NGS. Immune epitope prediction was performed on translated peptide sequences harboring detected mutations using the NetMHCpan v4.0 method in the Immune Epitope Database, with HLA genotyping performed using arcasHLA. Immune/stromal cell abundance was quantified using the Microenvironment Cell Populations Counter method. Gene expression profiles were analyzed for a transcriptional signature predictive of response to immunotherapy (T cell-inflamed signature, TIS). Results: Overall, the median patient age was 66 years (range 22-90), 72.8% were male, and 33.7% of samples were metastatic site biopsies. MMRd/MSI-H rate was 2.2% in EC, 12.4% in GC, and 2.5% in GEJ. A total of 1172 unique recurrent neoantigens with predicted binding-level affinity for patient specific HLA alleles were identified (317 in EC, 786 in GC, 157 in GEJ), with 442 and 552 neoantigens exclusively associated with MSS and MSI-H tumors, respectively. Across each cancer type, a higher positive TIS score correlated with both immune and stromal cell population abundance in the tumor microenvironment, most notably cytotoxic lymphocyte and monocytic cell types (r > 0.80, P < 0.0001). Recurrent peptides associated with highest average TIS scores resulted from mutation of TP53 (R248W, 2 peptides: 2.8%/3.2% of samples, respectively) and CUX1 (L162F, 1.6%) in MSS EC; REL (D318A, 2.3%) and ERBB2 (V842I, 1.2%) in MSS GC; MSH3 (K383fs, 36%) and ASXL1 (G645fs, 24%) in MMRd/MSI-H GC; and HOXD12 (A70-A71dup, 2.8%) and TP53 (R248Q, 3.7%) in MSS GEJ. Conclusions: This is one of the largest studies to investigate the landscape of recurrent neoantigens in upper GI cancers. We were able to identify candidate recurrent peptides with high HLA binding affinity and an association with a positive TIS signature in both MSI and MSS tumors, supporting the role of recurrent neoantigens as potential cancer immunotherapy targets.',\n",

       "  '247Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (SCE) in the US has declined since the 1970s. In comparison, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (ACE) has sharply risen in the US since the 1970s. This study aimed to examine temporal trends in incidence rates of EC, ACE, and SCE that include recent decades. Methods: Data were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) of the National Cancer Institute - a population-based cancer database. Using SEER*Stat, we calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR) for EC, ACE, and SCE in both SEER 9 (for longest follow-up time) and SEER 21 (the largest cohort covering 36.7% of the US population). Temporal incidence trends were examined using Joinpoint analyses to estimate the annual percent change (APC). Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Results: See Table. When stratified by age, age <64 years had a significant decrease in incidence with an APC of -1.1 (2007-2018), while the incidence plateaued in the remaining age groups. The rise in incidence was highest among non-Hispanic whites (NHW) from 2000-2004 (APC 4.0), especially NHW males (APC 3.0); however, the incidence plateaued in all race/ethnicity groups after 2006. Conclusions: The AAIR of EC as a whole has been decreasing since 2004. The AAIR of ACE has, for the first time, plateaued in the most recent decade (2006-2018), after having risen for three preceding decades (1975-2006); we find this effect is mainly driven by the AAIR from NHW males, age <64 years. The incidence of SCE has continued to decline since 1975.

       "  '248Background: Esophageal carcinoma is the 6th most common cause of death worldwide. While squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most common among the histologic subtypes in the 20th century, recent reports have demonstrated an increased incidence of adenocarcinoma in both Eastern and Western world. With this changing paradigm of esophageal carcinoma, it is important to estimate the future burden of esophageal carcinoma by histology, age, sex, and race, that could help plan prevention, control, and treatment strategies for this cancer. Methods: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 14 registries to obtain incidence data from 2000 to 2016. We applied age-period-cohort models to estimate future esophageal carcinoma incidence rates and the estimated disease burden by multiplying incidence forecasts by corresponding US Census population projections. Results: Our estimate suggests that the incidence (per 100,000 persons) of esophageal adenocarcinoma is increasing in people within the age group of 40-65 years. Our prediction showed that the incidence will increase from 2.12 in 2021 to 2.82 in 2030 (3.2% per year, 95% CI –2.3% to 9.1%, p=0.26). Notably, we noticed a similar marginal increase in incidence among Asians, Black, and Whites in the 40-65 years age group (3.1%, 3.2%, and 4.2%, per year, respectively). White males aged >65 years had the highest incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (17.34 in 2021), and incidence decreased 1.3% per year. We noticed a marginally decreased incidence in Black male (-1.1% per year, p=0.71) and Asian male (-3.9% per year, p=0.17) population aged >65 years. Interestingly, we found a decrease in the incidence of SCC in the current age groups 40-65 (-2.7% per year, p=0.31) and >65 years (-4.6% per year, p=0.081). We observed that Asians had the greatest decrease in incidence (-4.3% per year) as compared to that of Blacks (-4.2% per year) and Whites (-2.9% per year), although there was no statistically significant difference in the annual decrease among races. Conclusions: In our study of esophageal cancer, we predict an increased incidence of adenocarcinoma histology subtype in the younger age group (40-65 years) while the SCC subtype will have a decreased trend. Strategies to prevention esophageal adenocarcinoma, including dietary changes, should preferentially target patients <65 years of age.Prediction of esophageal carcinoma incidence by histology.AdenoAdenoSquamousSquamousAge (years)40-65>6540-65>65Incidence (2021)2.124.620.491.40Incidence (2030)2.824.430.380.92 ',\n",

       "  \"249Background: Since 1975, Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence has increased more than any other cancer (̃700%). Pre-malignant metaplastic tissue, or Barrett's Esophagus (BE), is the only known precursor for EAC. Periodic histological assessment of endoscopic biopsy along dysplasia-carcinoma sequence is used to assess progression risk. Current surveillance protocols have clinical limitations as 80% of patients still present with stage II-IV EAC. The aim of this study is to compare novel proteomic expression patterns to distinguish stable BE patients from those who developed EAC using the STLA101 assay. Methods: After Institutional Review Board approval patients with BE/GERD were identified. Two cohorts were selected: progressors (progressed to EAC at subsequent interval of 0.5-3 years) and non–progressors (̃10 yrs of f/u surveillance without progression along dysplasia/carcinoma path). 24 normal esophageal mucosa samples with no h/o of BE were also retrieved for baseline expression levels. Tissue sections were microdissected to isolate pure BE cells from surrounding stromal cells. BE cells underwent a multi-step process where tissue was heated and digested to produce a liquid biopsy for mass spec. Isotopically labeled control peptides representing the STLA101 panel were spiked in with digested tissue samples to quantify all of the markers simultaneously using a Triple-quad mass spectrometer. Results: A total of 95 tissues were analyzed. 29 BE biopsies progressed to EAC within a mean of 380 days while the remaining 28 BE and 14 GERD specimens did not progress over a 10-yr period. All 8 biomarkers were expressed at a higher level in BE tissue that progressed to cancer when compared to BE/GERD tissue that remained stable over 10 years. The assay had a 100% technical success rate as no samples yielded “non-detectable” data points. Conclusions: The differential overexpression of the STLA101 panel on progressive and non-progressive BE tissues demonstrates the clinical utility of STLA101 as a predictive biomarker panel for early detection of esophageal carcinogenesis. Non-progressive BE tissues were similar to normal mucosa, therefore, patients whose BE tissue samples resemble this profile may receive a reduced screening cadence. On the other hand, patients with overexpression of the STLA101 panel may be eligible to receive more frequent screening or therapeutic intervention.\",\n",

       "  '250Background: Camrelizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody, has shown promising efficacy with good tolerance in neoadjuvant therapy of resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC). The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of camrelizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy in a comparatively larger number of resectable EC patients in a real-world setting and initial results were reported here. Methods: In this prospective multicenter observational study (ChiCTR2000039170), patients with histologically confirmed resectable EC who were scheduled for camrelizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy at the discretion of treating physicians/ oncologists were included. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years, had ECOG PS of 0-1, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1, adequate organ function, and expected survival time of ≥ 3 months, as well as provided written informed consent. The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary endpoints were major pathologic response (MPR), pathologic complete response (pCR), R0 resection rate, overall response rate (ORR), one-year overall survival (OS) rate, and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: At total of 166 patients (62.9 ± 9.2 years, and 84.2% male) were enrolled between October 20 2020 and August 26 2021. All patients received neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapies (primarily nab-paclitaxel and nedaplatin) except one receiving camrelizumab alone. Overall, 109 patients (65.7%) experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), most commonly reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP, 45.3%), cough (10.4%), and pneumonia (8.5%). Thirteen (7.8%) patients experienced grade 3-4 TRAEs. There was no grade 5 toxicity. At the data cutoff, 141 (84.9%) patients were evaluable for radiological response, 82 (69.5%) patients underwent surgical resection. The ORR was 70.9% (100/141) and the R0 resection rate was 97.5% (79/82). Among the 81 patients available for pathologic assessment, 51 (63.0%) patients achieved MPR and of which, 15 (18.5%) had pCR. The median survival times have not been reached at the time of data analysis. Conclusions: The real-world data of our resectable EC patients showed effectiveness and safety profiles of camrelizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy consistent with those observed in previous trials.',\n",

Studies examining the relationship between baseline PROs and prognosis were included. Two reviewers screened articles and extracted data on study design, survival, univariable and multivariable relationships between PROs and prognosis. QUAL-SYST was used for quality assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: Of 3002 abstracts, seven studies were included: four pooled analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two RCTs and one cohort study. Five received QUAL-SYST scores >65%. Total 3,408 patients and 2,761(81%) with PRO data. Median survival ranged from 4.5 to 9.5 months. In one univariable analysis for oesophageal squamous cell cancer (SCC), physical functioning and fatigue measured by QLQ-C30 had prognostic significance. For adenocarcinoma, physical functioning, global QOL, role functioning, emotional functioning (QLQ-C30) were significant in three studies. Pain was significant in three studies (QLQ-C30 n=2, EQ-5D-3L n=1). Fatigue (QLQ-C30) was significant in two studies. Appetite loss (QLQ-C30) was significant in two studies. In multivariable analyses for oesophageal SCC (QLQ-C30) physical and social functioning had prognostic significance. In adenocarcinoma, physical functioning, role functioning, appetite loss, global QOL, social functioning and pain showed prognostic significance (Table). One study showed adenocarcinoma patients with lower anorexia (FAACT-A/CS scores of >37) lived longer (19.3 months) than patients with low scores ≤37 (6.7 months). Conclusions: Baseline PROs for multiple functional domains, symptoms (pain, appetite loss) and overall QOL have prognostic significance in advanced GO cancer.

       "  '252Background: The standard treatment for patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is platinum-based definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). Previous clinical trials have indicated a clinical complete response (cCR) rate of 11%-25% and median overall survival (OS) of 9-10 months. The cCR rate is strongly correlated with good prognosis, however the predictive factors have not been elucidated. Methods: In this multi-institutional retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of dCRT in patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC. “Unresectable” was defined as the primary lesion (T4b) invading adjacent structures such as the aorta, vertebral body, and trachea, or the regional and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes (LNT4b) invading unresectable adjacent structures. cCR was determined by both computed tomography and endoscopy based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) with modifications and Japanese Classification of Esophageal Cancer (11th edition), respectively. Results: A total of 175 patients who started dCRT between January 2013 to March 2020, were included in this study. The overall median age was 68 (31-86). A total of 95 (54%) patients had a performance status of 0. Of these, 124 (71%) patients had T4b and 81 (46%) had LNT4b. The clinically involved site were as follows: thoracic aorta (22%), tracheobronchial tree (73%), and others (14%). The median tumor length was 6 (2-22) cm. 56 (32%) patients were tube-fed owing to obstructive tumors. 165 (96%) patients completed at least one cycle of chemotherapy with 60 Gy of radiation. Further, 84 (48%) patients received consolidation chemotherapy following dCRT. The confirmed cCR rate was 24% (42/175). At a median follow-up interval of 20 months, the 2-year OS and progression-free survival (PFS) rates of cCR cases vs. non-cCR cases were 90% vs. 31% (log-rank p < 0.001) and 59% vs. 2% (log-rank p < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis of the clinicopathological factors contributing to cCR revealed that a tumor length of≥6 cm (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.9 p = 0.03) was the only a significant predictive factor. The primary adverse events of grade 3 or above were esophagitis (32%), pneumonitis (13%), fistula formation (10%), febrile neutropenia (9%), and dyspnea (6%). Among 22 patients who originally presented with fistula formation, fistula disappeared in 14 (64%), including 3 cCR cases. Two (1%) sudden deaths secondary to severe hemorrhage and suspected aortic fistula were observed during the treatment period. Conclusions: dCRT is feasible for patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC. The cCR rate of dCRT is consistent with that reported in previous clinical trials, and favorable OS and PFS rates were observed in patients with cCR. Tumor length was observed to be a significant predictive factor of cCR. Research Sponsor: None.',\n",

       "  '254Background: Gastrectomy with D2 dissection and adjuvant chemotherapy is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) in Asian countries. However, administering chemotherapy with sufficient intensity after gastrectomy is often challenging. Thus, several trials have been undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). NAC-SOX regimen for LAGC has been already shown to reduce distant micro-metastasis and to improve the R0 resection rate by tumor shrinkage in Asian trials. However, there have been few studies of the feasibility of NAC-SOX for elderly patients with LAGC. KSCC1801 is a phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NAC-SOX in elderly patients aged 70 years or over with LAGC. Methods: Patients received three cycles of SOX as neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by gastrectomy with D2 dissection. Oxaliplatin was administered intravenously (130 mg/m2) on day 1, and S-1 was administered orally (80- 120 mg/day) for 14 days followed by 7-day rest period. The primary endpoint was the dose intensity (DI). A sample size of 25 was set according to a one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 80% on the basis of a one-sample t-test and assuming a null hypothesis of a 75% DI and an alternative hypothesis of an 85% DI with an estimated standard deviation of 14%. The secondary endpoints were safety, R0 resection rate, response rate, overall survival, and relapse-free survival. Results: Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study. The median age was 74.5 years. The median DI in NAC-SOX was 97.2% for S-1 and 98.3% for oxaliplatin. Three cycles of NAC could be performed in 25 patients (96.2%), of whom 23 (88.5%) underwent gastrectomy with D2 dissection. The R0 resection rate was 92.3% and the pathological response rate (≥grade 1b) was 62.5% [95% confidence interval: 40.6 - 81.2]. The major adverse events (≥grade 3) were neutropenia (20.0%), thrombocytopenia (11.5%), anorexia (11.5%), nausea (7.7%) and hyponatremia (7.7%). Postoperative complications of abdominal infection, elevated blood amylase, and bacteremia occurred in one patient each. One treatment-related death occurred, probably due to severe diarrhea and dehydration. Conclusions: NAC-SOX was feasible and promising even in elderly patients. Systemic management and more careful monitoring of adverse events are necessary for elderly patients. Clinical trial information: jRCTs071180001.',\n",

       "  '255Background: With the advent of immunotherapy as an option for gastric, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or esophageal cancer, guidelines recommend testing for mismatch repair (MMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) at time of advanced cancer diagnosis. However, little real-world information is available on testing patterns and results for MMR/MSI and PD-L1. Methods: This study used the nationwide Flatiron Health electronic health record-derived de-identified database. Starting with a subset of 1594 patients (pts) from the Advanced Gastric/ Esophageal Cancer database who had initiated first-line (1L) treatment 01Jan2017-31Aug2020 and for whom additional abstraction for details on MMR/MSI and PD-L1 testing was conducted, adult pts with ≥3 months (mos) of follow-up were selected. 1L initiation was index date. For each biomarker, pts were classified as tested vs not. Pt and disease characteristics and test results were summarized. Testing relative to line of therapy and PD-1 inhibitor use were evaluated (data will be presented later). Results: Of 1142 eligible pts, 88% were initially diagnosed with advanced disease and 92% treated in community practice. 582 (51%) were tested for MMR/MSI and 571 (50%) for PD-L1; 451 pts were tested for both. MMR/MSI testing rates were 59% for gastric, 51% for GEJ, and 46% for esophageal. PD-L1 testing rates were similar across primary tumor sites (48-54%), but lower in those with squamous histology (38% for esophageal/GEJ). For both, testing increased over time with ̃40% in 2017 and 60% in 2020. For both, median number of tests per pt was 1 (range 1-6 for MMR/MSI, 1-4 for PD-L1). For both, mean time from initial diagnosis to first test was approximately 4 mos (> 5 mos in pts in 2017 and < 2 mos for those in 2020). Majority (> 68%) of all tests used tissue from primary tumor site. 46% of all MMR/MSI tests were performed with immunohistochemistry and 43% with next-generation sequencing; 5% were dMMR/MSI-H. 71% of all PD-L1 tests were performed using the commercial 22C3 assay. Reported composite positive score (CPS) results are summarized below. Conclusions: Rates of MMR/MSI and PD-L1 biomarker testing are increasing and time relative to initial diagnosis is shortening. A high proportion of pts tested positive for PD-L1 with CPS > 1. PD-L1 CPS varies by primary tumor site, histology, and tissue collection site.

       "  '256Background: KSCC1701 trial showed the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus ramucirumab as a first-line treatment for elderly patients with advanced/recurrent gastric cancer. However, some frail patients may not benefit from S-1 plus ramucirumab. We aimed to clarify the usefulness of G8 screening tool for stratifying the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus ramucirumab therapy to elderly patients with advanced/recurrent gastric cancer. Methods: Patients aged 70 and older with previously untreated unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer were included from 23 institutes in Japan. They received S-1 (40-60 mg twice daily for 28 days, every 6 weeks) plus ramucirumab (8 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the one-year survival rate. The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), and safety. The exploratory endpoint was detection of differences in treatment response by G8 screening tool. Results: Between September 2017 and November 2019, 48 patients were enrolled in this study. The cut-off value of G8 was determined as 11 by time-dependent ROC curve analysis for OS. Patients of G8 high (> = 11) and low (< 11) were 31 and 15, respectively. The characteristics of patients with G8 high/low were male: 21 (65.6%)/13 (81.3%), median age: 77/78 years, and PS (0): 16 (50.0%)/4 (25.0%). The one-year survival rate (total/G8-high/G8-low) was 65.2%/82.6%/26.7%. The median OS and PFS (total/G8-high/G8-low) were 16.4/20.7/6.9 months and 5.8/7.2/3.9 months, respectively. On Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for OS and PFS, the hazard ratio of G8-high was 0.156 [95%CI:0.066-0.367 (p < 0.0001)] and 0.391 [95%CI:0.202-0.755 (p = 0.0038)], respectively. The best RR (total/G8-high/G8-low) was 41.9%/55.6%/23.1%. The frequent grade 3 adverse events (total/G8-high/G8-low) was 78.7%/77.4%/81.3%. The frequent grade 4 adverse events (total/G8-high/G8-low) was 14.9%/16.1%/12.5%. Conclusions: Based on the results, G8 screening tool is useful for selecting elderly patients with advanced/recurrent gastric cancer in whom S-1 plus ramucirumab treatment shows a longer survival and a higher RR. Further examination including adverse events is therefore warranted. Clinical trial information: UMIN000028309.',\n",

       "  '257 Background: NIVO therapy is a standard care treatment for heavily pretreated patients with AGC. Improvement in objective response rate (ORR) to CTx after NIVO therapy for various cancer types has been reported. However, the efficacy and safety of CTx for AGC after progression on NIVO remains unclear. Methods: The REVIVE trial was a prospective, multicenter, observational study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of CTx in NIVO-refractory or NIVO-intolerant patients (pts) with AGC (UMIN000032182). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) of CTx following NIVO therapy. The median threshold and expected survival times were set as 4.0 and 7.0 months (M). The secondary endpoints are ORR, disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidence of adverse events (AEs), including immune-related adverse events (irAEs). CTx consisted of irinotecan alone (IRI), trifluridine/tipiracil alone (FT), and oxaliplatin-containing regimens (OX). Results: Of 395 pts treated with NIVO who met the eligibility at formal registration from Jun 2018 to Sep 2020, 199 pts who received CTx after NIVO were evaluated. Pt characteristics were as follows: median age, 69 years; male, 70%; ECOG PS 0/1/2, 38/51/12%; histology (diffuse/intestinal), 39/59%; metastatic lesions (peritoneum/liver/lung), 38/34/15%; number of metastatic organ sites (0–1/≥2), 40/60%; measurable lesions, 83%; and CTx regimens (IRI/FT/OX), 64/31/5%. Median OS and PFS were 7.5 M (95%CI, 6.7–9.7) at 145 events for OS and 2.9 M (95%CI, 2.2–3.5) at 184 events for PFS. The ORR and DCR were 17.0% (95%CI, 11.6–23.6) and 46.7% (95%CI, 38.9–54.6). Median OS, median PFS, ORR, and DCR according to CTx regimens (IRI/FT/OX) were 8.1/7.1/6.2 M, 3.3/2.8/2.4 M, 18.9/10.9/25.0%, and 47.8/43.5/50.0%, respectively. At the start of CTx, 42 pts had irAEs due to prior NIVO therapy. The most common any-grade and grade ≥3 AEs during CTx included decreased appetite (46% and 7.5%), fatigue (26% and 2.5%), nausea (24% and 1.5%), constipation (16% and 0%), and diarrhea (28% and 4.0%). No treatment-related deaths were observed. Conclusions: Prior NIVO therapy may lead to improved prognosis after CTx without unexpected AEs in pts with AGC, warranting further investigations after NIVO is approved as first-line treatment.All (n = 199)IRI (n = 128)FT (n = 61)OX (n = 10)Median OS, M7.58.17.16.2Median PFS, M2.93.32.82.4ORR, %17.018.910.925.0DCR, %46.747.843.550.0 ',\n",

       "  '258Background: An acceleration of tumor growth during immunotherapy, (hyperprogressive disease [HPD]: defined as >2 times increase in tumor growth rates during nivolumab compared with prior chemotherapy, Champiat S, 2017) has been reported. We reviewed the prevalence and clinical outcomes of HPD in AGC patients treated with nivolumab, and reported that there were no differences either in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) between patients with HPD and those with PD other than HPD (Suzuki T, ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium 2020). Then, we hypothesized that PD in unmeasurable lesion (ascites representing peritoneal metastasis) and appearance of new lesions, which are not included in definition of HPD, might have influenced the prognosis of AGC. Methods: The subjects of this retrospective study were 245 AGC patients with measurable disease who received nivolumab after failure of >2 chemotherapy regimens, and their responses were assessed at least 3 times (during prior therapy, before and after nivolumab) in 24 institutions. We explored the impact on prognosis of HPD, new lesion, increase of ascites in AGC patients receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg or 240 mg/body intravenously every 2 weeks. We divided patients to 4 group according to new lesions at different organ/increase of ascites: Group (G) 1 (-/-), G 2 (+/-), G 3 (-/+), G 4 (+/+). Results: One hundred forty-seven patients (60%) showed PD, and their PFS and OS were 1.5 months(M) and 4.8 M, while those of 41 patients (16.7%) with HPD were 1.4 M and 5.0 M. Fifty-three patients showed appearance of new lesions at different organ and 58 patients showed increase of ascites (31 patients showed both). Survival outcomes of the 4 groups are shown in the Table. Patients with appearance of new lesions at different organ showed shorter prognosis compared with patients without it (median OS: G 2+4 vs G 1+3, 3.3 M vs 7.1 M; hazard ratio [HR], 1.8 [95% CI: 1.2–2.7]; p = 0.003). Also, patients with increase of ascites showed shorter prognosis compared to patients with stable/decrease of ascites (median OS: G 3+4 vs G 1+2, 3.0 M vs 7.8 M; HR, 2.6 [95% CI: 1.8–3.8]; p < 0.001). More of patients with increase of ascites could not receive subsequent chemotherapy after disease progression than others (G 1+2 vs G 3+4, 51.7% [46/89] vs 75.9% [44/58]; p = 0.03). Large tumor size, number of prior lines of chemotherapy, and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at baseline were associated with G 4. Conclusions: Appearance of new lesions at different organ and increase of ascites, not HPD, were disease progression pattern associated with poor prognosis in AGC patients receiving nivolumab.PD patternnmedian OS (M)hazard ratio95%CIpGroup1678.0 [6.3–9.4]ReferenceGroup2224.5 [3.3–9.0]1.60.9-2.90.8641Group3273.6 [2.6–4.6]2.71.6-4.6< 0.001Group4312.6 [2.1–3.3]3.22.1–3.3< 0.001 ']]"

      "359881Background: Sunitinib is approved for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after imatinib failure. Ripretinib, a broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRA switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is indicated for the treatment of adult patients (pts) with GIST who received prior treatment with 3 or more TKIs, including imatinib. We compared the efficacy and safety of ripretinib vs sunitinib in pts with advanced GIST who progressed on or were intolerant to imatinib. Methods: This multicenter, global, randomized, open-label phase 3 study (NCT03673501) enrolled adult pts with GIST who progressed on or had intolerance to imatinib. Pts were randomized 1:1 to ripretinib 150 mg once daily (QD) or sunitinib 50 mg QD (4 wks on/2 wks off). Randomization was stratified by KIT mutational status and imatinib intolerance. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiologic review (IRR) using modified RECIST version 1.1. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) by IRR and overall survival (OS). Hierarchical testing was performed for primary and key secondary endpoints in a prespecified sequence; testing pts with a KIT exon 11 primary mutation (Ex11 intention-to-treat [ITT] population) preceded the all-patient (AP) ITT population. Data cutoff was 1 Sep 2021; final analyses of PFS and ORR and the first interim analysis of OS were conducted. Results: A total of 453 pts were randomized to ripretinib (n = 226; Ex11 ITT, n = 163) or sunitinib (n = 227; Ex11 ITT, n = 164). Median age was 60 yrs (range 18–88) and most pts were white (66.2%) males (62.0%). PFS was not statistically different between ripretinib and sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.66, 1.16; P = 0.36; median 8.3 vs 7.0 mos) or in the AP populations (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82, 1.33; P = 0.72; median 8.0 vs 8.3 mos). ORR was numerically higher for ripretinib vs sunitinib in the Ex11 ITT (23.9% vs 14.6%; difference 9.3%, 95% CI 0.7, 17.8; nominal P = 0.03) and AP ITT populations (21.7% vs 17.6%; difference 4.2%, 95% CI −3.2, 11.5; nominal P = 0.27). OS data was highly immature; median OS was not reached in either arm. Fewer pts in the ripretinib arm experienced Grade 3-4 (G3-4) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) vs sunitinib (41.3% vs 65.6%). Among G3-4 TEAEs with a difference ≥5% between arms, ripretinib had fewer events vs sunitinib (hypertension [8.5% vs 26.7%], palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia [1.3% vs 10.0%], neutropenia [0% vs 6.3%], and neutrophil count decreased [0% vs 7.2%]). Conclusions: The PFS in both arms was longer than PFS achieved by sunitinib in its pivotal phase 3 trial. While the PFS for ripretinib did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority vs sunitinib, meaningful clinical activity and fewer G3-4 TEAEs were observed in pts with advanced GIST treated with ripretinib after imatinib failure. Clinical trial information: NCT03673501.\n"

      "LBA1Background: PARADIGM is the first prospective trial to test the superiority of PAN vs. BEV in combination with standard doublet first-line chemotherapy for patients (pts) with RAS WT mCRC and left-sided primary tumors. Methods: This open-label, multicenter trial in Japan (NCT02394795) randomly selected pts with chemotherapy-naive RAS WT mCRC to PAN + mFOLFOX6 or BEV + mFOLFOX6. Overall survival (OS) as primary endpoint was hierarchically tested in patients with left-sided tumors, followed by those in the full-analysis set (FAS) population. Key secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and curative resection (R0) rate. Results: From May 2015 to June 2017, 823 pts were randomized; 12 did not receive protocol treatment and 9 were excluded due to major deviation of inclusion criteria. A total of 400 pts received PAN and 402 pts received BEV as FAS; 312 and 292 pts had left-sided primary tumors, respectively. OS was analyzed after 448 OS events in left-sided pts with a median follow-up of 61 months. PAN significantly improved OS vs. BEV in both populations: left-sided (HR, 0.82; 95.798% CI, 0.68-0.99, p = .031, which crossed the boundary of significance [0.042]), and FAS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; p = .030, with < 0.05 as the boundary). Although PFS was comparable between treatment groups, RR and R0 resection rates were higher with PAN compared with BEV (Table). HR for OS in the right-sided population was 1.09. No new safety signal was observed. Conclusions: PAN significantly improved OS vs. BEV in combination with mFOLFOX6 in pts with RAS WT and left-sided mCRC, establishing a standard first-line combination regimen for this population.
